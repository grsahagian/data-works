Is Kid Cudi serious? This is the first thing I asked myself listening to Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven, and it's not as snide a question as it sounds; it's genuinely hard to tell. While his diehard fans await his long-delayed Man on the Moon III*,* Cudi opted instead to release *this—*a 90-minute, double-disc rock album, unfiltered and unpolished even compared to his 2012 side-project WZRD. Cudi is not a very good singer or guitarist, and his artlessly blunt lyrics are even more exposed in this context. So what are we to make of this? It's tough to guess the motives of someone who commissions Mike Judge to wedge painful "Beavis and Butthead" skits in between songs about self-harm with nihilistic lines like "I’m feeling I’m a goner."
