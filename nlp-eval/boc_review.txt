Boards of Canadaâ€™s 1998 album is a beat-music touchstone, a record that took the previous decade of home-listening electronic music and essentially perfected it. This reissue offers a chance for a fresh look. Sometimes an album is so good and makes its case so flawlessly that it spawns a mini-genre of its own and becomes shorthand for a prescribed set of values. The Velvet Underground's third and Miles Davis' Bitches Brew are two older records that spring to mind, and I'd toss in Spiderland as well. It's not a long list, but somewhere on it belongs Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children.
